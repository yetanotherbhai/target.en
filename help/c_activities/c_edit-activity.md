## Copying/Editing an Activity When Using Workspaces {#section_45A92E1DD3934523B07E71EF90C4F8B6}

A workspace lets an organization assign a specific set of users to a specific set of properties. In many ways, a workspace is similar to a report suite in [!DNL  Adobe Analytics]. 


>[!NOTE]
>
>Workspaces are part of the Properties and Permissions functionality available as part of the [!DNL  Target Premium] solution. They are not available in [!DNL  Target Standard] without a [!DNL  Target Premium] license. 



If you are part of a multi-national organization, you might have a workspace for your European web pages, properties, or sites and another workspace for your American web pages, properties, or sites. If you are part of a multi-brand organization, you might have a separate workspace for each of your brands. 

For more information about workspaces and the Enterprise User Permissions functionality, see [ Enterprise User Permissions ](../c_seting_up_target/property_channel/property_channel.md#concept_E396B16FA2024ADBA27BC056138F9838). 

If you have Enterprise User Permissions enabled in your environment, you can copy activities to the same workspace or to another workspace. You cannot currently move an activity from one workspace to another. To copy an activity to another workspace, from the [!UICONTROL  Activities] page, hover over the activity you want to copy, click the [!UICONTROL  Copy] icon (  ![](assets/icon_copy.png) ), then select the desired workspace from the drop-down list. 

Consider the following information when using the copy/edit functionality with workspaces: 


* When you copy an activity within same workspace, the first step of the creation flow of the newly copied activity opens in edit mode. 

* When you copy an activity to a different workspace, the activity is copied to the other workspace without opening it in the activity creation flow. After the activity is copied successfully, a message displays indicating that the activity was copied successfully and includes a link to open the new activity. 



If your environment does not have the Enterprise User Permissions functionality enabled, all activities open in edit mode before copying.
