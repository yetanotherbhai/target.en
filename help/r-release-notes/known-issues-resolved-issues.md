This issue surfaces, for example, when creating audiences based on cities, states, countries, etc. For example, when searching for "new york", the search does not return valid results. </p> <p>Workaround: We have increased the number of items in the list so that users are not blocked. For example, while searching for "new york", search for "new" and then scroll the list to see the "new york" item. This issue will be fixed in a future release. (TGT-32364) </p> </td>
