**Enhancements, Fixes, and Changes**

This [!DNL Target] release includes the following enhancements, fixes, and changes:

* Improved the handling of audiences referenced in Target activities that have been deleted in Adobe Audience Manager (AAM). (TGT-23338)

    * If an audience was deleted in AAM, a warning icon in both the [!UICONTROL Audience] list and the audience picker displays. A tool-tip in the UI also indicates that the audience was deleted in AAM. 
    * If you attempt to combine multiple audiences with a deleted audience, or if you attempt to save an activity that references a deleted audience, a warning message displays.

  See [About audiences](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/target/c_audiences.html). 

* Fixed an issue that prevented users in certain situations from being able to create an activity when Adobe Analytics was selected as the reporting source on the [!UICONTROL Setup] page. Users saw a "Please select a report suite" message even though they were not given the option of selecting the report suite. (TGT-31968)

**Enhancements, Fixes, and Changes**

This [!DNL Target] release includes the following enhancements, fixes, and changes:

* Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the most-widely deployed security protocol used today for web browsers and other applications that require data to be securely exchanged over a network. Adobe has security compliance standards that require the end-of-life of older protocols and is mandating the use of TLS 1.2 in order to have the most up-to-date and secure version in use. Starting with the Target 18.4.1 release (April 25, 2018), Adobe Target will take steps to move towards TLS 1.2 encryption and phase out support for TLS 1.0 encryption completely by September 12, 2018. It is important that you go through the specifics and plan out the changes for a smooth transition. For more information, see [TLS (Transport Layer Security) Encryption Changes](../c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/c-tls-transport-layer-security-encryption.md#concept_CC1001E9D3AE4BABAF90B8311B0A6451). 
* UI for Recommendations Criteria Cards has been improved for better usability. (TGT-27829)

**Enhancements, Fixes, and Changes**

This [!DNL Target] release includes the following customer-facing enhancements, fixes, and changes:

* You can delete imported audiences (Target Classic, Experience Cloud, etc.) from the Audience Library. Target warns you if you try to delete an audience used for an active activity. (TGT-25171) 
* Audiences imported from Target Classic are now labeled as Adobe Target Classic in the Audience Library. In the past, the UI did not differentiate between Target Standard/Premium and Target Classic. (TGT-27093) 
* Collections now apply to all criteria (including recently viewed items). (TGT-26646) 
* You can filter by Workspace in the Audience Library and Offer Library (applies to Target Premium users with Enterprise User Permissions). (TGT-26813) 
* Made improvements in the Reports UI for better scrolling in tables and placements of filter drop-down lists. (TGT-23713 & TGT-26819)

**Enhancements, Fixes, and Changes**

This [!DNL Target] release includes the following customer-facing enhancements, fixes, and changes (issue numbers in parentheses are for internal Adobe use):

* Users with Approver permissions can now generate and enable profile API authentication tokens. (TGT-24074)

  For more information, see [Profile API Settings](../c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/c-methods-to-get-data-into-target/c-profile-api-settings.md#concept_5C4ABA5FA64E4D6CAE9C5902572F2794). 

* When creating an activity in the Visual Experience Composer and the user reloads the page, the activity URL and associated properties are retained in the UI. The need to reload can occur if the activity uses mixed content (secure and insecure content) or there are permission issues. (TGT-28230) 
* Improved the messaging when an activity uses mixed content (secure and insecure content). The message provides information to help users perform the necessary steps needed to open an HTTP site or a site that has mixed calls (HTTPS and HTTP). (TGT-26271)

  For more information, see [Enabling Mixed Content in Your Browser](../c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/c-mixed-content.md#concept_46D022D50280468C9EF6D5DF6EFC911C). 

* Improved the workflow when a user's Target session times out while configuring options on the Setup, Audiences, and Recommendations pages. When the user clicks Save, the session-expired message displays, but after logging back in, a dialog informs the user of a successful login and the UI remains on the same page in Target with no data loss. (TGT-25557)

This [!DNL Target] release includes the following customer-facing enhancements, fixes, and changes: (issue numbers in parentheses are for internal Adobe use):

This [!DNL Target] release includes the following customer-facing enhancements and fixes: (issue numbers in parentheses are for internal Adobe use):

* Improved the workflow when a user's [!DNL Target] session times out while creating or editing an activity or offer. When the user clicks [!UICONTROL Save], the session-expired message displays, but after logging back in, a dialog informs the user of a successful login and the UI remains on the same page in [!DNL Target] with no data loss.

  If a user performs intermittent action on a [!DNL Target] page and experiences a session timeout, the user is directed to re-log in and is then directed to the last page worked on in the [!DNL Target] UI.  

* Fixed an issue that caused custom code changes to be lost if the user browses away (changes experiences, switches page, switches audience, clicks Next, etc.) and forgets to save changes. The user is now prompted to save the changes. (TGT-23766) 
* When an activity is archived, "Archived the activity" displays instead of "Updating the activity." (KB-1517) 
* The drop-down picker in the following locations within the Target UI has been replaced with auto-complete functionality to improve speed and performance: (TGT-22939)

    * Activity Page > *activity* > Step3 > Report Suite picker 
    * Audiences > Create Audience > Visitor Profile 
    * Recommendations > Feed Creation > When source type > Analytics > Report Suite picker

* Improved error messaging when a site has "X-Frame-options" set to SAMEORIGIN and the site cannot be loaded in the Visual Experience Composer (VEC). The message prompts the user to switch to the Enhanced Experience Composer in Setup > Preferences. (TGT-17356) 
* Reports in Target Standard/Premium now display in your account's time zone rather than the Target server time zone (US EST). (TGT-24868) 
* If activities created in [!DNL Target] are updated from outside of [!DNL Target] (for example, via Adobe I/O), the following activity attributes are imported back into [!DNL Target]:

  `thirdpartyId`

  `startDate`

  `endDate`

  `status`

  `priority`

  `marketingCloudMetadata(remoteModifiedBy)`

  This import job will run when the activities page is opened, with a maximum delay of ten minutes. (KB-1526)

>[!NOTE]
>
>The ability to view multiple metrics in a report, included in the Target 17.3.1 release (March 30, 2017) has been removed due to unexpected behavior. This feature will be available again in an upcoming release.

This [!DNL Target] release includes the following enhancements and fixes: :

* The [!DNL Target] user interface has been updated to support redirect offers in activities that use [!UICONTROL Analytics for Target] (A4T) as the reporting source. This functionality will require [!DNL at.js] 0.9.6, which will be available soon. 
* The [!DNL Target] user interface was updated in some places:

    * In reports and activities, some options ( [!UICONTROL Edit], [!UICONTROL Share to Feed], [!UICONTROL View Experience URLs], etc.) are now accessed by clicking the [!UICONTROL More Options] icon (  ![](assets/icon_more_options.png)    
    
      ). 
    * In the [!UICONTROL Offers] library, offers now display in a list rather as cards. Other minor UI changes were made throughout the [!UICONTROL Offers] library UI.

* Significantly improved performance on the [!UICONTROL Activity] and [!UICONTROL Audience] lists. Also, load times for search results return significantly faster. 
* "Views" is now "Visits" in the [!UICONTROL Offer Level Report] for [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] reports. 
* [!DNL Target] now supports switching of environments (host groups) for [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] activities. 
* [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] activities now support host groups.

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.2 with FP-11577 (or later) now supports [!DNL at.js] implementations with its [!UICONTROL Adobe Target Cloud Services] integration. For more information, see [Feature Packs](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/release-notes/feature-packs.html) and [Integrating with Adobe Target](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/administer/integration/marketing-cloud/target.html) in the *Adobe Experience Manager 6.2* documentation.

This [!DNL Target] release focuses on usability and performance improvements and includes the following enhancements and fixes (issue numbers in parentheses are for internal Adobe use):

* Added additional items to the Help menu that can be accessed from the top right corner of the [!DNL Target] user interface. New options include: "Blogs" and "Videos." The "Adobe Experience Cloud Status" option is now "Adobe Target Standard/Premium Status." (TGT-22629) 
* When deleting an audience, [!DNL Target] displays a list of activities that reference that audience. Users can click each activity in the list to display its [!UICONTROL Overview] page. (TGT-17997) 
* Improved `user.activeCampaigns` to return the campaign ID for all campaigns/activities that the user is in, even if he or she has not interacted with the campaign/activity in the current session. (TNT-26237) 
* The [!UICONTROL Create Activity] button on the [!UICONTROL Activities] page is now active before all activity names are loaded in the list. This improvement lets users create new activities faster, especially when the account has many configured activities. (TGT-21470) 
* Made enhancements to the Enhanced Experience Composer (EEC) to improve loading time for websites running HTTPS accessed via proxy. Target no longer fetches static resources via proxy. (TGT-21793) 
* Made performance improvements on the [!UICONTROL Goals & Settings] page, especially load time when many metrics are defined for an activity. (TGT-21654) 
* Added a tool tip on the [!UICONTROL Goals & Settings] page of all activities using [!UICONTROL Analytics for Target] (A4T) reporting informing users that a tracking server is not required if the activity's pages have at.js (version 0.9.1 or later) or mbox.js (version 61 or later) loaded. (TGT-22607) 
* Metric names now display on the [!UICONTROL Goals & Settings] page without users needing to expand each metric to view the entire metric name. This improvement lets users edit metrics quicker and more efficiently. (TGT-21276) 
* You can now apply [!DNL Recommendations] inclusion rules to custom criteria (uploaded via CSV), just like any other criteria. (TGT-21896) 
* Improved the user interface and usability of the [!UICONTROL Offers] page, especially when creating or managing folders and creating offers. (TGT-22509 and TGT-22187) 
* Improved the user experience in the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC) when selecting items to hide. 
  (TGT-22224) 
* Improved the user experience when creating activities using the [!UICONTROL Form-Based Experience Composer]. When choosing an mbox location, the validation border remains highlighted after clicking [!UICONTROL Next]. (TGT-22221) 
* Enhanced the downloaded reports to differentiate between active and deleted offers. (TGT-22449) 
* Fixed an issue that prevented older assets from displaying in the infinitely scrollable asset list in the Experience Cloud Assets core service user interface. (TGT-19733) 
* Fixed an issue where the extreme order setting was not honored in downloaded CSV reports. (TGT-21871) 
* Fixed an issue where extreme orders were not marked correctly in the downloaded [!UICONTROL Order Details]CSV report. (TGT-22500) 
* Fixed an issue that caused the incorrect order time to display in the downloaded [!UICONTROL Campaign Audit] CSV report, even though the report displayed the correct order date. (TNT-26469) 
* Fixed an issue that prevented the [!UICONTROL Disable JavaScript] option from working correctly on multi-page activities. (TGT-15130) 
* If you use the Form-Based Experience Composer with an mbox other than the auto-created global mbox ( `target-global-mbox`), and then choose an engagement metric as a success metric, the metric increments only on pages that have the mbox used in the activity. As an example, if your mbox is `homepage_mbox`, the [!UICONTROL Pages Per Visit] metric is the number of hits to the `homepage_mbox` during that visit.

  If this is not what you want, you can add another location to the activity and assign the global mbox to that location and give it default content. This workaround connects the global mbox to the activity and allows Target to count the metric for reporting.

## Adobe Target Standard/Premium 16.6.1 (June 16, 2016) {#section_C1E9F43111BF4160AF31482CD53E00BD}

There is no customer-facing release planned for June.

**Fixes**

This release includes the following fixes:

* Fixed an issue where some customers saw a white screen when trying to edit their page inside the Visual Experience Composer.

**Known Issues**

The following known issues have been reported:

* When "Disable JavaScript" is selected for page A in a multipage activity, JavaScript is disabled everywhere, even though "Disable JavaScript" isn't selected on other pages. 
* Issue with experience preview URLs for experiences with a redirect. As a workaround, in the Experience Composer, click **[!UICONTROL Configure]**, choose **[!UICONTROL Multiple Audiences]**, and add **[!UICONTROL All visitors]** as the only audience. Continue to save your activity. This does not change the delivery of your activity, but allows preview to work. This will be fixed in the July release of Adobe Target. 

* The documentation shows the expected behavior for the Redirect URL checkbox. However, due to a bug, the check box does not show as selected by default. This defect will be fixed soon.

  To check this option in an existing activity with a redirect offer, use the following workaround:

    1. Open the Redirect to URL popup. 
    1. Change the URL to a dummy URL and save. 
    1. Change the dummy URL again to your campaign's expected redirect URL. 
    1. Check the "Include Current Query Parameters" option, and save.

  If you check the option while creating a new redirect offer, you can expect your query parameters to be included in the redirection.

  For older activities, if this option is checked in the experience composer of your activity, it means your redirection will include the query parameters. If it is not checked, current query parameters will not be included in redirection.

**Enhancements**

Improvement made to improve the A4T provisioning process.

**Known Issues**

The following known issues have been reported:

* When "Disable JavaScript" is selected for page A in a multipage activity, JavaScript is disabled everywhere, even though "Disable JavaScript" isn't selected on other pages. 
* Issue with experience preview URLs for experiences with a redirect. As a workaround, in the Experience Composer, click **[!UICONTROL Configure]**, choose **[!UICONTROL Multiple Audiences]**, and add **[!UICONTROL All visitors]** as the only audience. Continue to save your activity. This does not change the delivery of your activity, but allows preview to work. This will be fixed in the July release of Adobe Target.

## New Target Implementation Library, at.js 0.8.0 (May 5, 2016) {#section_6A44C277E82D409AB6DCD0901F43794A}

at.js is a new implementation library for Target designed for both typical Web implementations and single-page applications.

at.js replaces mbox.js for Adobe Target implementations.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Although at.js replaces mbox.js, mbox.js will continue to be supported. For most people, at.js provides advantages over mbox.js. This gives you time to test at.js and to change the implementation on your pages.

Among other benefits, at.js improves page load times for Web implementations, improves security, and provides better implementation options for single-page applications.

at.js contains the components that were included in target.js, so there is no longer a call to target.js.

When implementing at.js, be aware of the following:

* Visual Experience Composer redirects do not work. 
* Internet Explorer versions earlier than 8 are not supported. 
* Asynchronous implementation means legacy integrations like the Test&Target to SiteCatalyst plugin may not work. 
* Target plugins that reference mbox.js objects and methods are not supported. 
* All calls to Target are made via XMLHTTPRequest and content is returned via JSON.

## Target Platform Changes {#section_8295A808A4CE405C9DA2893E7935238E}

* [Mbox.js version 60](../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/t-mbox-download/r-mboxjs-change-log.md#section_3BDAB885FA13444A8D35940A4BFF5825) is now the default download. 
* Mbox.js versions earlier than 50 are no longer actively tested. If your implementation is not yet updated, ensure additional QA is performed on all Target content delivery and reporting collection. 
* Flash campaigns and other Flash-related items have been removed from Target. 
* Internet Explorer 10 is no longer supported in the Target interface. 
* Support for content delivery in Internet Explorer 8, 9, and 10 is expected to end in an upcoming release.

  Active testing will be discontinued in a future release for these browsers, following the end of active support for these browsers by Microsoft. Target will continue to deliver content to these browsers, but you should test content delivery and data collection for reports.

## Adobe Target Standard/Premium 16.4.1 Fix (May 5, 2016) {#section_70552F61E83140C7B4D2A245198B630E}

* at.js v 0.8.0 is now available for download from the Target interface. 
* Target APIs changed. `applyOffer` now requires `mbox param [0]`.

  ```
  adobe.target.applyOffer({ 
      "mbox": "target-global-mbox", 
   "params": {"test": "true"}, 
      "selector": ".banner-text", 
      "offer": offer 
  });

**Fixes**

This release includes the following fixes:

* Fixed an issue that caused all AEM-based activities as Experience Targeting (XT) activities. AEM now uses the correct activity types for A/B and XT activities. 
* Removed an option to use non-conversion metrics as a goal in new Auto Allocated activities. This restriction will be lifted in an upcoming release. 
* Fixed an issue that prevented deletion of a profile script created in Target Classic from Target Standard. 
* Fixed an issue that wrapped a non-HTML Recommendations template in a `<div>` element when used in a form-based workflow. 
* Fixed an issue that caused collision calculations to time out with a large number of activities. 
* Fixed an issue that resulted in the CSV download showing the Summary report rather than the Success Metrics report. 
* Removed "Unique ID" pop-up message that sometimes appeared when editing elements.

**Known Issues**

The following known issues have been reported:

* When "Disable JavaScript" is enabled for pageA in a multipage activity, JavaScript remains enabled for all pages but the functionality remains disabled. 
* Some interface issues might occur in Internet Explorer 10, including screen flicker and possible slowness. 
* The Chrome version 48 update introduced an issue that causes the Visual Experience Composer to function incorrectly in Chrome. Google is working on a solution.

**Fixes**

This release includes the following fixes:

* For Analytics for Target based activities, the Lift and Confidence columns are now hidden for Analytics metrics where the calculations cannot be performed. 
* Fixed an issue where the short format of the `charset` metatag was not recognized in the Enhanced Experience Composer

**Known Issues**

* Target-based conversion events for multivariate testing in Target Standard/Premium are not being reported when Analytics is being used as the reporting source for Target. This issue is expected to be fixed soon. 
* mbox.js version 56 moved the "extra JavaScript" section so it is executed before global mbox.

  All settings in v56+ are name spaced. If there are functions declared in "extra JavaScript," they must be prefixed with window. See [mbox.js Change Log](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/ov/r_mboxjs_change_log.html).
