## How are Lift Bounds Calculated? {#section_1D360781D972483693680BE0F07AEAD1}

The lift bounds represent the 95% confidence intervals of the lift that the specific experience or offer has over the control experience or offer. Loosely speaking, it means the actual lift has about a 95% chance of being between these bounds. 

The lift bounds are calculated using the following formula: 

![](/migration-test-20180813/assets/lift diagram.png) 

There is some additional calculation to arrive at the input to our lift bounds: 


* **t-value: **The critical statistic for our 95% confidence level is 1.96. You can learn more about [ t-values here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-statistic). 

* **Lift Variance: **The Standard Error of Experience N’s success metric and the Standard Error of the Control Experience’s success metric are needed to determine the lift variance, which is calculated using the following formula (illustrated in the case the success metric is conversion). 

  ![](/migration-test-20180813/assets/lift variance.png) 

* **Conversion Rate / Success Metric Standard Error: **Standard error is calculated in the same way for Experience N and the Control, using the following formula (illustrated in the case the success metric is conversion). You can learn more about [ standard error here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error).

## Example Calculation {#section_35BD6FB7AFD346E28BA093147C248471}

Let’s consider an example activity with two experiences and the following results: 



<table id="table_484C2AC096034CCDB1223D5216C28277"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Experience </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Visitors </th> 
   <th colname="col3" class="entry"> Conversions </th> 
   <th colname="col4" class="entry"> Conversion Rate </th> 
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Experience A (Control) </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>219, 328 </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col3"> <p>2,466 </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col4"> <p>1.12% </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Experience B </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>218, 362 </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col3"> <p>3,040 </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col4"> <p>1.39% </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

Based on our formulas, we can calculate the inputs we need for the lift bounds. 

**Standard Error for Experience A (Control)**

**Standard Error for Experience B** 

![](/migration-test-20180813/assets/standard error B.png) 

**Lift Variance for Experience B** 

![](/migration-test-20180813/assets/lift variance B.png) 

**Lift Bounds for Experience B** 

Expected Lift for Experience B: 

![](/migration-test-20180813/assets/lift bounds B.png) 

Therefore, the lift bounds for Experience B would be:

## When Are Lift Bounds Not Displayed? {#section_C5622E1E94684DAD937249B51A9E42CC}

In certain cases, Target does not display lift bounds: 


* For any activity, when the total number of visits or visitors is fewer than 30. 

* For Auto-Allocate activities, no lift bounds are displayed until one experience has attained 60% confidence.
