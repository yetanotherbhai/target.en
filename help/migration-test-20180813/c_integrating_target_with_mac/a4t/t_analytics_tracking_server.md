# Using an Analytics Tracking Server


>[!NOTE]
>
>If you use Adobe Analytics as your activity's reporting source, you do not need to specify a tracking server during activity creation if you are using ` mbox.js` version 61 (or later) or ` at.js` version 0.9.1 (or later). The ` mbox.js` or ` at.js` library automatically sends tracking server values to [!DNL  Target]. During activity creation, you can leave the [!UICONTROL  Tracking Server] field empty on the [!UICONTROL  Goals &amp;amp; Settings] page. 



To ensure that data from Target goes to the correct location in Analytics, A4T requires an analytics tracking server to be sent in all calls to Modstats from Target. For implementations using multiple tracking servers you can use the Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger to determine the correct tracking server for your activity. 

The debugger should be viewed on a page where the activity will be delivered to ensure you select the correct tracking server. You can also specify a default tracking server for each account. Contact Customer Care to specify or modify the default. 

>1. From the page on which you are creating your activity, open the Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger.

>       If you have not installed the debugger, follow the [ Adobe Debugger installation instructions ](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/implement/debugger_install.html). 

>       ![](/migration-test-20180813/assets/Screen_DebuggerTrackServ.png) 

>       The analytics tracking server is found in the SiteCatalyst Image section of the debugger. The field is called *First Party Cookies* or *Third Party Cookies* depending on the implementation, and the Analytics tracking server value will be in one of these formats: >    
>    * (for CNAME implementations) 

>    * (for non-RDC implementations) 

>    * (for RDC implementation) 



>       *Company* represents the Analytics company name, *metrics* is an example of a CNAME value, and *d1* is an example of an Analytics data center. 
>1. Copy the entire contents of the field.
>1. In the [!UICONTROL  Reporting Settings] section of the [!UICONTROL  Goal &amp;amp; Settings] screen of your activity, paste the tracking server information in the ** [!UICONTROL  Tracking Server] ** field.
