# Test an Email Image Adbox

Redirectors can be used in emails to track clicks and dynamically control which landing page people reach. 

Email image testing is achieved through using modified versions of adboxes. Because email clients do not allow cookies to be set, a unique identifier must be generated for each email. This number is appended to the adbox URL and to any redirectors used in the email to track clicks from the email. 


>[!NOTE]
>
>Although Target can technically deliver image optimization at open time, each email client handles caching differently, so success will be varied. Regardless of the email service provider used, the email client that the end user uses to open the email (Gmail app, Outlook, Hotmail, and so forth) determines whether the image is actually fetched at open-time. For example, Gmail caches most everything, so the image the end user sees is dependent on when Gmail chooses to call and cache the image.



**Sample code for an email image adbox:** 


```
<img src="http://<
<b class="+ topic ph hi-d="" b "="">
 clientcode>.tt.omtrdc.net/m2/​
 <b class="+ topic ph hi-d="" b "="">
  clientcode/ubox/​
  <b class="+ topic ph hi-d="" b "="">
   image?mbox=​
   <b class="+ topic ph hi-d="" b "="">
    email_Header&amp;mboxDefault=​
    <b class="+ topic ph hi-d="" b "="">
     http%3A%2F%2Fwww.domain.com%2Fheader.jpg&amp;​ 
         
     <b class="+ topic ph hi-d="" b "="">
      mboxXDomain=disabled&amp;​
      <b class="+ topic ph hi-d="" b "="">
       mboxSession=123456&amp;​
       <b class="+ topic ph hi-d="" b "="">
        mboxPC=123456" border="0" > 
             
          
       </b class="+ topic>
      </b class="+ topic>
     </b class="+ topic>
    </b class="+ topic>
   </b class="+ topic>
  </b class="+ topic>
 </b class="+ topic>
</b class="+ topic>
```
