# Target Page Methods by mbox.js Library Version


>[!NOTE]
>
>If you use [!DNL  at.js], all calls are made using JSON. This page provides details about [!DNL  mbox.js] library versions. The behaviors described in the scenarios below do not apply to [!DNL  at.js]. 



This section provides information about how each version of the [!DNL  Target] library responds to the [!DNL  Target] call from your page in each of the following scenarios: 


* [ No Visitor ID Implementation ](c_call-Responses-library-version.md#section_C6F7213FDE4D48E8BBCB1A9A26310FEE)
* [ Visitor ID Implementation Present, but No Visitor ID Set Yet ](c_call-Responses-library-version.md#section_29888A119C7A4753AD287FC845AA63F4)
* [ Visitor ID Implementation Present, and Visitor ID Exists ](c_call-Responses-library-version.md#section_9CD4AE4C8186425D886398BC3CE6C46D)


There are several types or endpoints, depending on your implementation and library version. You should be familiar with each type to understand how [!DNL  Target] responds to calls in each scenario.

>[!IMPORTANT]

>For any type but standard, all custom code and offers should be written to support an ajax environment. For example, if you use a JavaScript that includes ` document.write()`, the script will not work as expected. 



## No Visitor ID Implementation {#section_C6F7213FDE4D48E8BBCB1A9A26310FEE}

If you are using [!DNL  Target Standard] or [!DNL  Premium] with [!DNL  mbox.js], and you have enabled [!UICONTROL  Create Global Mbox] for your account,  the **autocreate global mbox synchronous** type of call and response is made, regardless of [!DNL  mbox.js] version. 

If you write your own custom code rather than using the [!UICONTROL  Visual Experience Composer] actions, make sure your code is appropriate for an ajax environment. For example, if you use a JavaScript that includes ` document.write()`, the script will not work as expected. 


>[!NOTE]
>
>Multiple ajax mbox calls with the same mbox name but different parameters will not work on the same page. Only the first call will be made.



If you use "auto-create global mbox" but also have ` mboxCreate` calls on your page, for example, if you are implementing [!DNL  Target Standard] or [!DNL  Premium] on a page that previously used in a legacy implementation, the global mbox calls are made using the** autocreate global mbox - standard** endpoint and the ` mboxCreate` calls are made using the **standard** endpoint. The **standard** endpoint uses ` document.write()` to make the call and to respond. This blocks the page load, including content delivered in the ajax response, until all information is downloaded. 

If you use only mboxCreate, for example on pages created using [!DNL  Target Classic], the page works as it always has. 



|  Creation Method  | mbox.js v57  | mbox.js v58  | mbox.js v59  | mbox.js v60  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  autocreate global mbox  | autocreate global mbox - synchronous  | autocreate global mbox - synchronous  | autocreate global mbox - synchronous  | autocreate global mbox - synchronous  |
|  mboxCreate  | standard  | standard  | standard  | standard  |


## Visitor ID Implementation Present, but No Visitor ID Set {#section_29888A119C7A4753AD287FC845AA63F4}

If no visitor ID has been set, there is no [!DNL  Experience Cloud] visitor cookie for the user. The page calls out to the Visitor ID service to get the visitor ID. Target waits for the response with the ID making the call to [!DNL  Target]. 


>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL  Mbox.js] v58  is strongly recommended to ensure that the visitor ID returns before the Target call is made. 



If you are using [!DNL  mbox.js] version 57 in this scenario, everything works as it does if there is no visitor ID implementation, as described in the previous scenario. Beginning with [!DNL  mbox.js] version 58, the [!DNL  Experience Cloud Visitor ID] service returns with a visitor ID before [!DNL  Target] calls are made. This ensures that audience data shared through the Profiles and Audiences core service are available for the first [!DNL  Target] call in the visitor's session. To avoid flickering of default content before test content returns, [!DNL  Target] hides the ` &amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt;` until the visitor ID service returns. In version 58, ` display:none` is used to hide the page. This creates some problems with responsive sites, so beginning with version 59, ` opacity:0` is used to hide the content. 



|  Creation Method  | mbox.js v57  | mbox.js v58  | mbox.js v59  | mbox.js v60  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  autocreate global mbox  | autocreate global mbox - synchronous  | autocreate global mbox - asynchronous  | autocreate global mbox - asynchronous  | autocreate global mbox - asynchronous  |
|  mboxCreate  | standard  | ajax  | ajax  | ajax  |


## Visitor ID Implementation Present, and Visitor ID Exists {#section_9CD4AE4C8186425D886398BC3CE6C46D}

If the visitor ID cookie exists, [!DNL  Target] does not need to make a call to the Visitor ID service. In this case, there is no need to wait for the Visitor ID service before displaying content. For versions 57 to 59, the **autocreate global mbox - synchronous** type is used, so the page waits for the call to [!DNL  Target] to return before continuing to load. This ensures no flicker of default content is seen. For v60, the **global mbox-asynchronous type** is used to ensure [!DNL  Target] waits for the [!DNL  Experience Cloud] opt-out service to respond. The opt-out service is part of the Data Co-op releasing in the fall of 2016. Because all calls are returned using ajax , ` document.write()` should not be used with [!DNL  mbox.js] version 60. 



|  Creation Method  | mbox.js v57  | mbox.js v58  | mbox.js v59  | mbox.js v60  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  autocreate global mbox  | autocreate global mbox - synchronous  | autocreate global mbox - synchronous  | autocreate global mbox - synchronous  | autocreate global mbox - asynchronous (to support development of the Data Co-op, which will be released later in 2016)  |
|  mboxCreate  | standard  | standard  | standard  | ajax  |
