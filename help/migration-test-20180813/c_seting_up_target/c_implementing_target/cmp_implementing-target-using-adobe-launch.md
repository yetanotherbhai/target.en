## Advantages of Implementing at.js Using the Target Launch Extension {#section_48B3F938B6F8491DAF798E0DB54EF304}

The following advantages apply only if you use Adobe Launch to implement at.js. For this reason we strongly suggest that you use Adobe Launch rather than DTM or a manual implementation of at.js. 


* **Allows for Asynchronous Deployment of Target: ** For more information, see "Adobe Target Extension with an Asynchronous Deployment" in [ Adobe Target Extension](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/extension-reference/adobe-target-extension). 

* **Solves Analytics and Target Race Condition: **Because the Analytics call could be fired before the Target call, the Target call is not stitched to the Analytics call, which can lead to incorrect data. Starting with Launch 0.6.0, the Target Launch extension ensures that the Analytics beacon call will wait until the Target call completes, successfully or not. This should solve the data inconsistency customers might have experienced. 

* **Prevents Incorrect Redirect Offer Handling: **When you have both Target and Analytics on the page, and there is a redirect offer being executed by Target, you might run into a situation when the Analytics tracker fires a request when it shouldn’t, because the user is being redirected to a different URL. If you implement Target and Analytics via Launch, you’ll not experience this issue, because using Launch, Target will instruct Analytics to abort the Analytics beacon request.
