# Uploading Data for Target's Personalization Algorithms

There are several ways to input data in Automated Personalization (AP) and Auto-Target personalization algorithms. In addition to the methods in [ Methods to get Data into Target](../c_seting_up_target/c_implementing_target/c_methods-to-get-data-into-target.md#concept_0069C0EFB56C4700BB33F2F35C2B9B17), Experience Cloud shared audiences (Adobe Analytics, Audience Management) and in-activity reporting audiences are also used in our algorithms. 

For information about the data automatically collected and used by Automated Personalization and Auto-Target personalization algorithms, see [ Automated Personalization Data Collection](../c_activities/t_automated_personalization/r_ap_data.md#reference_255BD3DE7AD04DC9B766E0BC78961058). 

## Best Practices {#section_DE96C7B7D114491DBB67FB5B7DA3D37B}

The following list presents best practices for uploading data for Target's personalization algorithms: 


* The more high-quality data that is available to Target’s personalization algorithms, the better the quality the resulting models in your AP and Auto Target activities. 

* Limit using multiple profile scripts or attributes that serve the same purpose. 

* Don’t pass a unique Id, such as a session ID if not needed. 

* Review what data Target automatically collects ([ Data Collection for Target's Personalization Algorithms](../c_activities/t_automated_personalization/r_ap_data.md#reference_255BD3DE7AD04DC9B766E0BC78961058)) so that you don’t send duplicate information. For example, Target uses IP addresses to determine visitors' ZIP codes. It is not necessary to pass this information as a separate variable. 

* Do not pass multiple values in the same attribute/variable. If multiple variables are concatenated, Target’s personalization algorithms treat each string as a unique value, reducing the value of the information for personalization. 

* Use a memorable and meaningful naming convention to make your [ Personalization Insights Reports](../c_reports/c_personalization-insights-reports.md#concept_A897070E1EDC403EB84CFB7A6ECAD767) more understandable.
