Because you can fetch content for multiple mboxes, for performance, it makes more sense to use batch the mbox API.

## Differences Between Server Side Delivery APIs and the NodeJS SDK {#section_10336B7934F54CE98E35907A4748A4A4}

Many customers are confused about the differences between the Server Side delivery APIs and the NodeJS SDK. This is especially true when it comes to performance. 

The following FAQs should help you decide which to use: 

**When should you use "raw" Server Side APIs versus the NodeJS SDK?** 

Ideally if you are using NodeJS as your backend technology, NodeJS SDK is a natural choice. The SDK handles a lot of details, such as cookies, headers, payload, and so forth. This lets you focus on the core of your application. 

**Should I gain any performance improvements by using the NodeJS SDK?** 

Unfortunately, we don't have any performance numbers. However, in general, the NodeJS SDK should good performance, thanks to the NodeJS event-driven architecture. Be aware that most of the time is spent on the Target backend. The NodeJS SDK does very little processing. The SDK is basically responsible for packaging a Target request and parsing a Target response.
