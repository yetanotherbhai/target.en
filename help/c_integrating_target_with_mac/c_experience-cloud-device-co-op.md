# Experience Cloud Device Co-op

The Experience Cloud Device Co-op empowers participating brands to recognize their consumers so they can deliver more personalized experiences across devices and apps at massive scale. The Device Co-op is a core service of the Adobe Experience Cloud. It is available to Adobe customers who use Analytics, Audience Manager, Media Optimizer, or Target.
