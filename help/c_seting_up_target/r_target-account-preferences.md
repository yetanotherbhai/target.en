## Site Details {#section_04A3340FC29B46978DB77058259F4EE0}

Select the optional custom mbox name you are using to deliver Target activities. This global mbox must be empty, meaning it has no default content. Save this setting only after the updated [!DNL  mbox.js] file is installed on your site. 


>[!CAUTION]
>
>Configuring this setting incorrectly might result in an outage for existing activities.



## Results and Reporting {#section_47C887AABD704A96BCD1C00BEABF4BCE}

## CSS Selectors {#section_8155EDBF449E4198863235F94D1EA872}

Specify how Target generates CSS selectors. 

These options help Target understand your site's structure to generate better CSS selectors for content delivery. By default, Target generates selectors based on element IDs on the page. If your site uses few IDs, or duplicates IDs on the same page, then using classes might be a better option. 

You can choose one or both of the following options: 



<table id="table_36A0F371B60E4FDC9F4559EE735FB32E"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Option </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Description </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Use element IDs </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Deselect this option if the same ID is used for multiple elements or if element ID might change on page load. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Use element classes </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p> By default, Target only uses element IDs. However, if your page is designed to use classes to identify elements, such as a page built with <span class="keyword"> Adobe Experience Manager </span>, you should also select <b>Use element classes</b>. </p> <p> <p>Note:  Although everything has been done to assure accuracy, be aware that using classes can result in errors. If you do not select either option, accuracy is also affected. The order of accuracy is IDs &amp;gt; classes &amp;gt; neither option. Always be sure to test your page to make sure the selectors are correct. </p> </p> <p>You can override this setting per activity (click the Settings gear icon, then select <span class="uicontrol"> CSS Selectors </span>). This is especially useful if you have multiple sites that are configured differently. </p> <p> <p>Note:  Overriding the setting per activity is not available in Automated Personalization and Multivariate Testing activities. </p> </p> <p>See <a href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/target/c_vec_selectors.html" format="https" scope="external"> Element Selectors Used in the Visual Experience Composer </a> for additional information about selectors. </p> </td>
