## Permissions Overview {#section_DC2172520DA84605B218A5E9FB6D187A}

The following information explains the way permissions were enforced previously in [!DNL  Target] and how they are enforced using the [!UICONTROL  Properties] and [!UICONTROL  Permissions] functionality. 

The new [!UICONTROL  Permissions] functionality lets you create different projects (called "Product Profiles" in the [!DNL  Adobe Admin Console for Enterprise]) to allow you to assign different permissions for a single user that dictate that user's access rights for each project. These distinct projects can be compared to the way that report suites work in [!DNL  Adobe Analytics]. Each project can have specific users with specific roles that apply to a set of properties. The result is that customers will be able to restrict the view, edit, and approval access to their users based on region, environment (dev/stage/prod), channel, or other custom criteria, as shown below: 

![](../assets/permissions.png) 

For example, a specific user might have "approval" access on the Americas websites but only "view" access on the European mobile app. That same user might not have any access to even view the activities offered on web and mobile properties in the APAC region. 

The current [!DNL  Target] [!UICONTROL  Permissions] model has three permission roles (Observer, Editor, and Approver), as shown in the following illustration: 

![](../assets/permissions 1.png) 

Each role has different levels of permissions: 



<table id="table_4B17E288A7364A738FE0637AC53820C8"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Role </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Description </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Observer </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Has read-only access to activities. Can view activities, but cannot create or edit them. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Editor </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Can create and edit activities before they are live, but cannot approve the launch of an activity. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Approver </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p> Can create, edit, and activate or stop activities. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

It is important to note that each user's role applies to every page, property, or site in your account that includes [!DNL  Target] tags, as shown below: 

![](../assets/permissions 2.png) 

The new [!DNL  Target] [!UICONTROL  Permissions] model has the same three permission roles (Observer, Editor, and Approver); however, you can assign a user's permissions roles separately for individual pages, properties, or sites, as shown below: 

![](../assets/permissions 3.png) 

In this example, Jan has Approver permissions to the US Homepage and the US Site and Observer permissions to the France Site. 

Furthermore, Jan won't be able to see pages, properties, or sites in [!DNL  Target] that she doesn't have permissions to see, as shown below: 

![](../assets/permissions 4.png) 

In this example, Jan cannot see the Product Pages, Russia Site, and the Careers Site. 

## Use Case Scenarios {#section_F3CE8576959E4F4CB13BEEED38311DD8}

The following use cases might be helpful to understand how properties, projects, roles, and permissions can help you achieve your marketing goals with [!DNL  Target]:

## Target UI Property and Permissions Touchpoints {#section_3414371393BB42999A268628B5456EC9}

The new Permissions functionality can be seen in various places in the [!DNL  Target] UI. 


* **Workspace (Product Profile) drop-down list: **The Workspace drop-down list displays at the top of the [!UICONTROL  Activities], [!UICONTROL  Audiences], and [!UICONTROL  Offers] pages. Select the desired workspace to filter the list to display only items in the selected workspace. 

  ![](../assets/workspace drop-down.png) 

* **Activity Creation: **When you create a new activity, it is created in the currently selected workspace. You'll see channel selection options in the first dialog box that lets you choose the desired channel for the activity: Web, Mobile App, Email, or Other/API. 

  ![](../assets/channel options.png) 

* **Audience Creation: **When you create a new audience, it is created in the currently selected workspace. 

* **Offer Creation: **When you create a new offer, it is created in the currently selected workspace. 

* **Properties page (Setup &amp;gt; Properties): **You can use the [!UICONTROL  Search] box, the [!UICONTROL  Channel], and [!UICONTROL  Product Profile] options to filter the [!UICONTROL  Property] List. 

  ![](../assets/properties list.png) 



## Caveats {#section_9714311B1CD9497A86F4910F8AE635E2}

Consider the following when using or configuring properties and permissions in Target Premium: 


* 
  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >Do not delete workspaces with activities. If this happens, work with client care to recover those activities.


* When using the All My Workspaces view: 


    * You can see activities, audiences, and offers for all workspaces that you have the proper roles and permissions to access. 

    * When you select the All My Workspaces view, a new column is added to the Activities, Audiences, and Offers page that lists the item's workspace and your user permission associated with that item (Observer, Editor, or Approver), 

    * When creating an activity, audience, or offer in the All My Workspaces view, you must select the workspace where the item is to be created. Only those workspaces can be selected for which you have the Editor or Approver permission. 

    * When copying an activity, audience, or offer in the All My Workspaces view, you must select the workspace where the item is to be copied. Only those workspaces can be selected for which you have the Editor or Approver permission. 



* Any setting on the following the Setup pages can be controlled by any Approver in any workspace: 

    * Preferences 

    * Implementation 

    * Scene7 Settings 

    * Hosts 


* Users cannot move resources from one workspace (product profile) to another. Copy, however, is supported. 

* When viewing audiences from the [!DNL  Audiences] page, the page loads slower than expected. If you interact with the search bar in any way, audiences display faster. This is a known issue and will be fixed in an upcoming update. This issue does not affect selecting audiences during the activity-creation workflow. 

* The following resources are or are not part of the new Enterprise Permissions model:

## Frequently Asked Questions {#section_31D3450ADEAE4A29963A34F8E8C19FE0}

**Can I move an activity from one workspace to another?** 

Unfortunately, you cannot move activities from one workspace to another. However, you can copy an activity to any workspace knowing that reporting data will not carry over. For more information, see "Copying/Editing an Activity When Using Workspaces" in [ Copying/Editing an Activity When Using Workspaces ](c_edit-activity.md#section_45A92E1DD3934523B07E71EF90C4F8B6). 

Activities created before the migration continue to run the same way in the Default Workspace unless they are edited and assigned properties. Activities under a specific workspace will honor properties assigned to that workspace and, therefore, behavior might not remain same as before the migration.
