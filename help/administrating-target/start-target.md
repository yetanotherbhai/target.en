# Administrator first steps{#administrator-first-steps}

This section contains the first steps [!DNL Target] administrators should take after receiving the emailed invitation to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud].

## Get invited to Target {#task_3E0817630774431983FAA3D2CB2E75BD}

A System Administrator in the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console] must add you as a user in [!DNL Target] by inviting you to join. The System Administrator should then add you to one or more role-specific groups. Both of these tasks are performed in the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com).

For more information, see [Manage Experience Cloud users and products](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/manage-users-and-products/admin-getting-started.html) in the *Experience Cloud and Core Services help*.

You will receive an invitation email after the System Administrator has performed these steps.

## Accept the invitation {#task_24FE66659E634B24AB61DB8497772E17}

After receiving the invitation to join the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud], accept the invitation, log in, and accept the End User License Agreement (EULA).

1. Accept the invitation to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud].
1. If you do not already have an Adobe ID, you are prompted to create one.

   If you do have an Adobe ID, then your Adobe ID is recognized and you are prompted to sign in. 
1. Accept the Terms of Use.
1. Review the summary of what you have done so far, then click **[!UICONTROL Continue to Experience Cloud]**.
1. Sign in to the Adobe Experience Cloud and click **[!UICONTROL Link Account]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you do not link your account, you will not be able to access [!DNL Target].

   All Experience Cloud products appear on the linking page. Click `Link Test&Target` and enter your Test&Target username and password to access Standard and Classic. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Continue to Experience Cloud]**.

   At this point, you do not yet have any groups set up with entitlements for you to link. 
1. If desired, watch the video introducing you to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud].
1. To see your new privileges and access the product, sign out of [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud], then sign back in.
1. Continue to the next step, [assigning yourself the Approver role](../administrating-target/start-target.md#task_15CAA437A71444E2932B333D5E66A3C7).

## Assign yourself the Approver role {#task_15CAA437A71444E2932B333D5E66A3C7}

After accepting the invitation to join the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] and logging in, confirm that Target has been added to your [!DNL Experience Cloud] account, then assign yourself the [!UICONTROL Approver] role for [!DNL Target].

If your organization has a [Target Standard](/help/c-intro/intro.md#section_ACD5EFF17AAB4E979CBEFA0145CCD905) license, see [Specify roles and permissions](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/c-user-management/user-management.md#roles-permissions) in *Users*.

If your organization has a [Target Premium](/help/c-intro/intro.md#premium) license, see [Step 6: Specify roles and permissions](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/property-channel/properties-overview.md#section_8C425E43E5DD4111BBFC734A2B7ABC80) in *Configure enterprise permissions*.

Your next step should be to set up users in Target Standard and Target Premium. For more information, see [User management](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/user-management.md).
