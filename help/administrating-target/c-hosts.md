Organize your sites and pre-production environments for easy management and separated reporting.

## Hosts {#concept_516BB01EBFBD4449AB03940D31AEB66E}

Organize your sites and pre-production environments for easy management and separated reporting. 

Similar functionality existed in [!DNL Target Classic]. Host groups in [!DNL Target Classic] were called "environments" in [!DNL Target Standard/Premium].

The primary goal of host management is to ensure that no inactive content accidentally appears on websites. Host management also lets you separate report data by environment.

A host is any web server (or web domain) from where you serve content during any stage of your project. Any host serving an mbox is recognized.

Hosts are bundled into environments for ease of management. For example, you might have dozens of hosts grouped in two or three environments. The preset environments include Production, Staging, and Development. You can add new environments and rename your environments, if desired.

One environment, the default environment, is pre-named Production. This default environment cannot be deleted, even if you rename it. [!DNL Target] assumes that this is where you will serve final, approved activities and tests.

When an mbox request is received from new websites or domains, these new domains always appear in the Production environment. The Production environment cannot have its settings changed, so unknown or new sites are guaranteed to see only content that is active and ready. Host management also lets you easily ensure the quality of new activities and content in your test, staging, and development environments before you activate the activities.

Target does not limit a host that can send and receive mboxes, so when new servers or domains come up, they automatically work (unless you've set up a whitelist or blacklist). This also enables ad testing on different domains you don't know or can't anticipate.

To manage hosts and environments, click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Hosts]**.

## Recognizing Hosts {#concept_0D4B43E23AA9408F8B28A57ED754BF65}

Information about the conditions that must be met for [!DNL Target] to recognize a host and add it to the Hosts list.

<!-- 

ov2/c_hosts-recognizing.xml

 -->

To recognize a host, the following conditions must be met:

* At least one mbox must exist on the host 
* A page on the host must have the following:

    * An accurate [!DNL mbox.js] reference 
    * An mbox or an auto-generated global mbox call

* The page with the mbox must be viewed in a browser

After the page is viewed, the host is listed in the [!UICONTROL Hosts] list, allowing you to manage it in an environment as well as preview and launch activities and tests.

>[!NOTE] {class="- topic/note "}
>
>This includes any personal development servers.

After a host is added to the [!UICONTROL Host] list, make sure that the host is recognized.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Hosts]**. 
1. If your host is not listed, refresh your browser. 
   By default, a newly recognized host is placed in the Production environment. This is the safest environment because it does not allow inactive activities to be viewed from these hosts. 
1. (Conditional) Move the host into the Development or Staging environment.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Production environment cannot be deleted, even if you rename it. It is assumed that this is where you will serve final, active activities and tests. The default environment does not allow inactive campaigns to be viewed.

## Manage Hosts and Environments {#concept_90573F5A52E04600A8C3C5897880C10F}

Information to help you manage hosts and environments (host groups,) including setting the default host for reporting, creating whitelists, changing an environment's name, moving a host to another environment, and deleting a host or environment.

To access the [!UICONTROL Hosts] list, click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Hosts]**.

![](assets/hosts_list.png)

## Filter, Sort, or Search the Hosts List {#section_068B23C9D8224EB78BC3B7C8580251B0}

To filter the [!UICONTROL Hosts] lists by environment, click the **[!UICONTROL All]** drop-down list, then select the desired environment (Production, Staging, Development, or a custom environment you have created).

To sort the [!UICONTROL Hosts] list, click any column header (Name, Environment, or Last Requested) to sort the list in ascending or descending order.

To search the [!UICONTROL Hosts] list, type a search term in the Search box.

## Select Multiple Hosts {#section_EF3B458475184B7EA997C3559714397C}

To select multiple hosts, select the check boxes next to the [!UICONTROL Name] column for the desired hosts. You can then move or delete all selected hosts.

## Create an Environment {#section_32097D0993724DF3A202D164D3F18674}

1. From the [!UICONTROL Hosts] list, click the **[!UICONTROL Environments]** tab. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create Environment]**. 
1. Specify a descriptive name for the environment. 
1. Specify the desired active mode for the environment: [!UICONTROL Active Activities] or [!UICONTROL Active and Inactive Activities]. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

## Set the Default Host for Reporting {#section_4F8539B07C0C45E886E8525C344D5FB0}

You can select the environment you want to use as the default for all activity reports.

If you use Production as your default, all unknown hosts automatically are added here and report data from there is included in the default report view. Instead, creating a "clean" environment ensures only your core sites/domains are included.

To set the default environment for reporting:

1. From the [!UICONTROL Hosts] list, click the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** tab. 
1. Select the default host from the **[!UICONTROL Environment Settings]** drop-down list. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL Recommendations] users must rebuild their behavior database and product database if hosts switch host groups.

## Create Whitelists that Specify Hosts That are Authorized to Send mbox Calls to Target. {#section_0AF7F56C386A42C381AF704DEF08D5CC}

You can create a whitelist that specifies hosts (domains) that are authorized to send mbox calls to [!DNL Target]. All other hosts generating calls will get a commented-out authorization error response. By default, any host that contains an mbox call registers with [!DNL Target] in the Production environment and has access to all active and approved activities. If this is not the desired approach, you can instead use the whitelist to record specific hosts that are eligible to make mbox calls and receive [!DNL Target] content. All hosts will continue to display in the [!UICONTROL Hosts] list, and environments can still be used to group these hosts and assign different levels to each, such as whether the host can see active and/or inactive campaigns.

To create a whitelist:

1. From the [!UICONTROL Hosts] list, click the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** tab. 
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Enable Authorized Hosts for Content Delivery]** checkbox. 
1. Add the desired hosts in the **[!UICONTROL Host Contains]** box, as desired.

   Multiple hosts can be listed, each on its own line. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

If an mbox call is made on an unauthorized host, the call will respond with `/* no display - unauthorized mbox host */`.

The whitelist takes precedence over environments. You should clear out all hosts before using the whitelist feature, then only the hosts allowed by the whitelist appear in your hosts list. You can then move the hosts into the desired environment.

Sometimes domains from other sites appear in your environments. A domain appears in the list if the domain makes a call to your `mbox.js`. For example, if somebody copies one of your web pages to their server, that domain appears in your environment. You might also see domains from spider engines, language translator sites, or local disk drives.

In cases where `mboxHost` is passed in an API call, conversion is recorded for the environment that is passed in. If no environment is passed, the host in the call defaults to Production.

You can also create a blacklist that specifies hosts (domains) than cannot send mbox calls to [!DNL Target] by adding the desired hosts in the [!UICONTROL Host Does Not Contain] box.

## Troubleshooting Hosts {#concept_B3D7583FA4BB480382CC7453529FE1B7}

Best practices for managing and troubleshooting hosts in [!DNL Adobe Target].

<!-- 

ov2/c_hosts_best-practices-and-troubleshooting.xml

 -->

Try the following troubleshooting tips if you experience problems with your hosts:

**Host does not appear in mbox list for your account.**

* Refresh the [!UICONTROL Hosts] page in your browser. 
* Confirm that the mbox code is correct, including the [!DNL mbox.js] reference. 
* Try browsing to one of the mboxes on the host. It's possible that no mbox on the host was ever rendered in a browser.

**Random or unknown domains appear in the [!UICONTROL Host] list.**

A domain appears in this list if a call to [!DNL Target] is made from the domain. Often, you could see domains from spider engines, language translator sites, or local disk drives. If the listed domain is not one your team uses, you can click [!UICONTROL Delete] to remove it.

**My mbox call returns /&#42; no display - unauthorized mbox host &#42;/.**

If an mbox call is made on an unauthorized host, the call will respond with /&#42; no display - unauthorized mbox host &#42;/.
