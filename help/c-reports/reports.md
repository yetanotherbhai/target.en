## Displaying a Report {#section_C4591A32F6D04C95A1AD5A377C27C28B}

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Activities]**, then click the desired activity from the list.

   If you have many activities, you can filter the list by selecting options from the [!UICONTROL Type], [!UICONTROL Status], [!UICONTROL Reporting Source], [!UICONTROL Experience Composer], [!UICONTROL Metrics Type], and [!UICONTROL Activity Source] drop-down lists.

   For example, you could select [!UICONTROL A/B Test] and [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] from the [!UICONTROL Type] drop-down list and [!UICONTROL Live] from the [!UICONTROL Status] drop-down list to display only A/B tests and Experience Targeting activities that are in an active state.

   The following illustration shows the [!UICONTROL Type] drop-down list with two types selected:
