The following information is not applicable when using Adobe Launch to implement Target.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The Target team maintains only two versions of [!DNL at.js]—the current version and the second-latest version. Please upgrade [!DNL at.js] as necessary to ensure that you are running a supported version. For more information about what's in each version, see [at.js Version Details](../../../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/r-target-atjs-versions.md#reference_DBB5EDB79EC44E558F9E08D4774A0F7A).

## Download at.js Using the Target Interface {#section_1F5EE401C2314338910FC57F9592894E}

To download [!DNL at.js] from the [!DNL Target] interface:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Implementation]**. 
1. Select **[!UICONTROL at.js]**. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Download at.js]**.

## Download at.js Using the Target Download API {#section_C0D9D2A9068144708D08526BA5CA10D0}

To download [!DNL at.js] using the API.

1. Get your client code.

   Your client code is available at the top of the **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Implementation]** > **[!UICONTROL Edit at.js Settings]** page of the [!DNL Target] interface. 

1. Get your admin number.

   Load this URL:

   ```
   https://admin.testandtarget.omniture.com/rest/v1/endpoint/<varname>client code</varname>
   ```

   Replace ` < *`client code`*>` with the client code from Step 1.

   The result of loading this URL should look similar to the following example:

   ```
   { 
     "api": "https://admin6.testandtarget.omniture.com/admin/rest/v1" 
   }
   ```

   In this example, "6" is the admin number. 

1. Download [!DNL at.js].

   Load this URL with the following structure:

   ```
   https://admin<varname>admin number</varname>>.testandtarget.omniture.com/admin/rest/v1/libraries/atjs/download?client=<varname>client code </varname>version=<version number>
   ```

    * Replace ` < *`admin number`*>` with your admin number. 
    * Replace ` < *`client code`*>` with the client code from Step 1. 
    * Replace ` < *`version number`*>` with the desired [ [!DNL at.js] version number ](../../../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/r-target-atjs-versions.md#reference_DBB5EDB79EC44E558F9E08D4774A0F7A) (for example, 1.6.2).

Please upgrade [!DNL at.js] as necessary to ensure that you are running a supported version.

   Loading this URL starts the download of your customized [!DNL at.js] file.

## at.js Implementation {#concept_03CFA86973A147839BEB48A06FEE5E5A}

at.js should be implemented in the `<head>` element of every page of your website. 

A typical implementation of Target not using a tag manager like [Adobe Launch](../../../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/cmp-implementing-target-using-adobe-launch.md#topic_5234DDAEB0834333BD6BA1B05892FC25) or [Dynamic Tag Management](../../../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/implementing-target-using-dynamic-tag-management.md#concept_3A40AF6FFC0E4FD2AA81B303A79D0B96) looks like this:

```
<!doctype html> 
<html> 
 
<head> 
    <meta charset="utf-8"> 
    <title>Title of the Page</title> 
    <!--Preconnect and DNS-Prefetch to improve page load time--> 
    <link rel="preconnect" href="//<client code>.tt.omtrdc.net"> 
    <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//<client code>.tt.omtrdc.net"> 
    <!--/Preconnect and DNS-Prefetch--> 
    <!--Data Layer to enable rich data collection and targeting--> 
    <script> 
        var digitalData = { 
            "page": { 
                "pageInfo": { 
                    "pageName": "Home" 
                } 
            } 
        }; 
    </script> 
    <!--/Data Layer--> 
    <!-- targetPageParams(), targetPageParamsAll(), Data Providers or targetGlobalSettings() functions to enrich the visitor profile or modify the library settings--> 
    <script> 
        targetPageParams = function() { 
            return { 
                "a": 1, 
                "b": 2, 
                "pageName": digitalData.page.pageInfo.pageName, 
                "profile": { 
                    "age": 26, 
                    "country": { 
                        "city": "San Francisco" 
                    } 
                } 
            }; 
        }; 
    </script> 
    <!--/targetPageParams()--> 
 
    <!--jQuery or other helper libraries should be implemented before at.js if you would like to use their methods in Target--> 
    <script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script> 
    <!--/jQuery--> 
    <!--Target's JavaScript SDK, at.js--> 
    <script src="at.js"></script> 
    <!--/at.js--> 
</head> 
 
<body> 
    The default content of the page 
</body> 
 
</html>
```

Consider the following important notes:

* The HTML5 Doctype (e.g., `<!doctype html>`) should be used. Unsupported or older doctypes could result in Target not being able to make a request. 
* Preconnect and Prefetch are options that might help your web pages load faster. If you use these configurations, ensure that you replace `<client code>` with your own client code, which you can obtain from the **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Implementation]** > **[!UICONTROL Edit at.js Settings]** page. 
* If you have a data layer, it is optimal to define as much of it as possible in the `<head>` of your pages before at.js loads. This placement provides the maximum ability to leverage this information in Target for personalization. 
* Special Target functions, such as `targetPageParams()`, `targetPageParamsAll()`, Data Providers, and `targetGlobalSettings()` should be defined after your data layer and before at.js loads. Alternatively, these could be saved in the [!UICONTROL Library Header] section of the [!UICONTROL Edit at.js Settings] page and saved as part of the at.js library itself. For more information on these functions, see [at.js functions](../../../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/cmp-at.js-functions.md#topic_8E33F5CDAB774AB891304DE2090AF80E). 
* If you use JavaScript helper libraries, such as jQuery, include them before Target so you can leverage their syntax and methods when building Target experiences. 
* Include at.js in the `<head>` of your pages.

## Track Conversions {#task_E85D2F64FEB84201A594F2288FABF053}

The Order Confirmation mbox records details about orders on your site and allows reporting based on revenue and orders. The Order Confirmation mbox can also drive recommendation algorithms, such as "People who bought product x also bought product y."

<!-- 

ov/t_create_orderconfirm-page-mbox-atjs.xml

 -->

>[!NOTE]
>
>If users make purchases on your website, we recommend implementing an Order Confirmation mbox even if you use Analytics for Target (A4T) for your reporting.

1. In your order details page, insert the mbox script following the model below.
1. Replace the WORDS IN CAPITAL LETTERS with either dynamic or static values from your catalog.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Use comma delimiting to separate multiple product IDs.

   **Tip:** You can also pass order information in any mbox (it does not need to be named `orderConfirmPage`). You can also pass order information in multiple mboxes within the same campaign.

   ```
   <script type="text/javascript"> 
   adobe.target.trackEvent({ 
       "mbox": "orderConfirmPage", 
       "params":{  
           "orderId": "ORDER ID FROM YOUR ORDER PAGE",  
           "orderTotal": "ORDER TOTAL FROM YOUR ORDER PAGE",  
           "productPurchasedId": "PRODUCT ID FROM YOUR ORDER PAGE, PRODUCT ID2, PRODUCT ID3"  
       } 
   }); 
   </script> 
   ```

The Order Confirmation mbox uses the following parameters:

<table id="table_CEB2E2F2265142D89672E124CB4C880B">

  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Parameter </th>
