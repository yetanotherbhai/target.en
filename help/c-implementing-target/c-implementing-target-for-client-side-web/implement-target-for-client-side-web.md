# Overview: implement Target for client-side web

In a client-side implementation of [!DNL Adobe Target], [!DNL Target] delivers the experiences associated with an activity directly to the client browser. The browser decides which experience to display and displays it. With a client-side implementation, you can use a WYSIWYG editor, the [Visual Experience Composer](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/visual-experience-composer.md) (VEC), or a non-visual interface, the [Form-based Experience Composer](/help/c-experiences/form-experience-composer.md), to create your activity and personalization experiences.

To implement [!DNL Adobe Target] client-side, you must use the [at.js](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/c-how-atjs-works/how-atjs-works.md) or mbox.js library.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The mbox.js library is no longer being developed. All customers should [deploy at.js](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/how-to-deployatjs.md) or [migrate from mbox.js to at.js](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/t-mbox-download/c-target-atjs-implementation/target-migrate-atjs.md).
