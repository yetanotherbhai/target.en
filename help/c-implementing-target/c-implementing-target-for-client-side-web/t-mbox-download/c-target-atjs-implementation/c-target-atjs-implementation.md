# Migrate from mbox.js to at.js{#migrate-from-mbox-js-to-at-js}

The at.js library is a new implementation library for Adobe Target designed for both typical web implementations and single-page applications.

Among other benefits, [!DNL at.js] improves page-load times for web implementations and provides better implementation options for single-page applications.

[!DNL at.js] replaces [!DNL mbox.js] for [!DNL Target] implementations. The [!DNL at.js] library also includes the components that were included in [!DNL target.js], so there is no longer a call to [!DNL target.js].

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.2 with FP-11577 (or later) supports at.js implementations with its Adobe Target Cloud Services integration. For more information, see [Feature Packs](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/release-notes/feature-packs.html) and [Integrating with Adobe Target](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/administer/integration/marketing-cloud/target.html) in the *Adobe Experience Manager 6.2 documentation*.

To use [!DNL at.js], replace the [!DNL mbox.js] reference on pages where you want to implement it. You cannot use both [!DNL mbox.js] and [!DNL at.js] on a single page. However, you can use either on each page on your site.

The [!DNL at.js] library works for existing implementations using the `mboxCreate()`, `mboxDefine()`, and `mboxUpdate()` functions and supports new functionality focused on single-page-app based implementations.

You can use [!DNL at.js] anywhere you currently use [!DNL mbox.js].

The [!DNL at.js] library offers several improvements over the [!DNL mbox.js] library, including:

* Completely asynchronous communication via cross domain AJAX

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >Although [!DNL at.js] communicates with the [!DNL Target] servers asynchronously, the [!DNL at.js] file itself must load synchronously in the `<head>` section of your page. Ideally, it should be one of the first scripts loaded. Once loaded, [!DNL at.js] executes mbox calls asynchronously through `XMLHttpRequest`, and does not block page rendering.

* No more blocking calls 
* No `document.write()` used 
* No immediate execution of JavaScript in [!DNL Target] responses 
* Better timeout and error handling

    * Customizable [timeout](../../../../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/cmp-at.js-functions.md#reference_C81525D1598A4A1199740DCAB81A7FDF) per call 
    * No reloads on timeouts

* Functions designed specifically for single-page apps/MVC frameworks
