This will also make it easy for your Adobe consultants to support you. </p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/dtm/target/t_implementing-target-manually-js-hosted-dtm.html" format="html" scope="external"> Option 3: Implement Target Manually with the Target JavaScript Library Hosted by DTM</a> in the <i>Best Practices for Implementing Adobe Target using Dynamic Tag Management </i>guide. </p> </td>

Then, any time your website tries to load <span class="filepath"> mbox.js</span>, it loads <span class="filepath"> at.js</span> instead.
