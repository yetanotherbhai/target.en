# Use a Global mbox from a Legacy Implementation

By default, Target Standard creates a global mbox called target-global-mbox, which is used to run activities created in Target Standard. However, if you have already created a global mbox on your pages for your legacy implementations, you can use that mbox for your Target Standard activities.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can have only one global mbox per account.

To use your existing global mbox for both [!DNL Target Standard] and your legacy implementation, you must set a few parameters. 

1. Go to [!DNL Target Standard], then click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Implementation]**.

   By default, [!UICONTROL Auto Create Global Mbox] is enabled, and the custom global mbox is named `target-global-mbox`. 
1. If you want to use an existing mbox, disable [!UICONTROL Auto Create Global Mbox], and specify the name of a previously created global mbox in the [!UICONTROL Custom Global Mbox] field.

   The [!UICONTROL Custom Global Mbox] drop-down lists all mboxes in your account. If you want to use an mbox that does not yet exist, create the mbox in Target Classic. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   The mbox.js settings for your account are updated. 
1. Download the new `mbox.js` file and reference it on your site.

   After you've updated your production site with the new `mbox.js` file, you are ready to set your preferences. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Setup]** > **[!UICONTROL Preferences]**.
1. In the [!UICONTROL Custom Global Mbox] field, specify the name of the global mbox you selected on the Implementation page.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Submit]**.

   All existing activities update to use the specified global mbox, including activities that have previously been created and implemented. 
**Troubleshooting Global Mbox Implementation** *Why is the global mbox not loading, or why is there latency in loading the global mbox when the page loads?*

Make sure the mbox.js reference is the first JavaScript call on the page. For other solutions to this problem, see [Mbox.js Implementation](../../../../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/t-mbox-download/t-mbox-download.md#task_4EAE26BB84FD4E1D858F411AEDF4B420).
