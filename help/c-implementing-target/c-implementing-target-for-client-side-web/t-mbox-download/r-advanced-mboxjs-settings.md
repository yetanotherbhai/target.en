# Configure mbox.js{#configure-mbox-js}

Information to help you set several settings on the mbox.js Settings page.

The default settings of the [!DNL mbox.js] function library serve the needs of most [!DNL Target] customers.

If needed, consult your account representative to change the [!DNL mbox.js] settings.

The following settings are available:

## Client

The client code for your account.

When viewing [!UICONTROL Setup > Implementation > Edit Mbox.js Settings], the Client at the top is the client code for your account.

## Timeout

The Target request timeout.

When viewing [!UICONTROL Setup > Implementation > Edit Mbox.js Settings], the Timeout after Compression Level is your Target request timeout. By default this value is set to 15 seconds, but we recommend setting it to a value between 2 seconds and 5 seconds.

## XDomain

Determines whether the browser sets cookies in your own domain (1st party cookies), Target's domain, or both.

Changing this setting affects both mbox.js and at.js.

## Compression Level

Determines how compressed the mbox.js library file is. Increasing the compression level decreases the page-load time.

## mboxParameters() function body

Returns extra parameters to pass to each mbox call.

For example:

return "test=123";

## mboxSupported() function body

Returns false to exclude specific users.

For example:

return !navigator.userAgent.indexOf('Safari') != -1;

The following browsers can be accepted or excluded:

*   IE 5.0 or greater (Windows)
*   Netscape 5.0 or greater (Mac, Windows, Linux)
*   Safari 1.2.4 or greater (Mac)
*   Mozilla Firefox 1.0 or greater (Mac, Windows, Linux)

## mboxCookieDomain() function body

Returns a string describing the domain to set first-party cookies.

For example:

return "YOUR-DOMAIN";

## Extra JavaScript

Includes any additional JavaScript you want to execute on each page.

## SiteCatalyst plug-in

Enables the Analytics Target plug-in.

If enabled, the Analytics plug-in generates plug-in code in mbox.js . This sends Analytics tag information to Target servers as an mbox request on every page tagged with Analytics .

Note that the Analytics plug-in must still be referenced on the page.

## secureOnly

Indicates whether mbox.js should use HTTPS only or be allowed to switch between HTTP and HTTPS based on the page protocol. This is an advanced setting that defaults to False.
