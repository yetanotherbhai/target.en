# adobe.target.trackEvent(options)

This function fires a request to report user actions, such as clicks and conversions. It does not deliver activities in the response.

These event-tracking mbox calls can then be used to define metrics in activities. For more information, see [Success Metrics](../../c-activities/r-success-metrics/success-metrics.md#reference_D011575C85DA48E989A244593D9B9924) and [Track Conversions](../../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/implementing-target-without-a-tag-manager.md#task_E85D2F64FEB84201A594F2288FABF053).
