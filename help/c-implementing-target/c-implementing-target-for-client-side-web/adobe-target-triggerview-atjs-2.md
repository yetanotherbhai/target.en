# adobe.target.triggerView (viewName, options) - at.js 2.x

This function can be called whenever a new page is loaded or when a component on a page is re-rendered. `adobe.target.triggerView()` should be implemented for single page applications (SPAs) in order to use the Visual Experience Composer (VEC) to create A/B Tests and Experience Targeting (XT) activities. If `adobe.target.triggerView()` is not implemented on the site, the VEC cannot be utilized for SPA. For more information, see [Single Page Application implementation](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/target-atjs-single-page-application.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>This function was introduced with at.js 2.x. This function is not available for at.js version 1.*x*.
