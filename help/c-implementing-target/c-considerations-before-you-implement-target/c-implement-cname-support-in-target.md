# CNAME and Adobe Target{#cname-and-adobe-target}

Information about working with Adobe Client Care to implement CNAME (Canonical Name) support in Adobe Target.

Perform the following steps to request CNAME support in Target:

1. Open a [Customer Care ticket](../../cmp-resources-and-contact-information.md#reference_ACA3391A00EF467B87930A450050077C) requesting CNAME support for your Adobe Target calls. 
1. Enroll in the [Adobe Managed Certificate (AMC) program](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/whitepapers/first_party_cookies/adobe_managed_cert_pgm.html) and follow the implementation steps provided in the *First-Party Cookies* guide.

   The AMC program helps eliminate effort and confusion experienced by customers when implementing first-party cookies. After enrolling to this program, Adobe will purchase and issue the certificate to install on secure servers.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >CNAME must be configured before enrolling in the AMC program.
