# Visual Experience Composer Best Practices and Limitations

By following these best practices, you are less likely to encounter unexpected problems with the experiences you design.

If new elements are injected into the body and code moves around, at least the parent elements have an easier way to be recognized.</p> <p>Adobe Target does not require IDs, but using IDs increases the reliability of experiences created with the experience composer. Target uses CSS selectors to modify your content when the experience is delivered. When you edit an experience, the Visual Experience Composer anchors the selector to the closest ancestor with a non-null id attribute to the HTML element being modified. It is, therefore, not advisable to use any mechanism, including JavaScript libraries, that sets or modifies HTML ID attributes. Although those IDs might be available to the Target experience composer for activity creation, if JavaScript modifies IDs, the ID that was used when the experience was created might not be available when the experience runs. If an ID is not available, the selector anchored to the ID fails.</p> </td>

   <td colname="col2"> <p>It is a good practice to minimize the use of iFrames, to simplify page and test management. The visual experience composer can apply some actions within an iFrame, but some actions, such as resizing, do not work properly. It is difficult to manage and resize pages that use multiple iFrames.

     </ul> </p> <p>Each change creates a new element in the Visual Experience Composer. Because the second action modifies Element 1, if you delete Element 1, the second action no longer has anything to modify, so the change no longer works.</p> <p>In other words, if you add an element with text, then in a separate action you edit that element with different text, the code editor shows both actions as separate elements. When you edited the element, you created a new element that modifies the original one you created, containing the edited text. If you then delete the original element, the edited text won't be able to find the element that was edited, and will not display. The second element remains in the list of elements, but it does not affect the page because the element it changes no longer exists.</p> <p>See <a href="c_vec_selectors.xml#concept_4EB7663E255F439B8D24079D23479337" format="dita" scope="local"> Element Selectors Used in the Visual Experience Composer </a>. </p> </td>

The Visual Experience Composer performs the action after the page component has been instantiated by JavaScript.</p> <p>However, when the content of the page is delivered to visitors, the action is applied before instantiation of the component. Because of this, this component's functionality may or may not break at the time of delivery. Functionality depends on the nature of the script used on his page to define the component.</p> <p>If you test for delivery and it works the first time, it is not guaranteed that it will continue working. There may (or may not) be a race condition.</p> <p>

## Caveats {#section_A0436B7B85BA467FA9DE13A9A40E6A6E}

Consider the following caveats when using the Visual Experience Composer to design your activity.

   <td colname="col2"> <p>If an element marked for click tracking is rearranged, the paths of the rearranged elements are changed. As a result, the element in the location where the original element was before it was rearranged is the one whose clicks are tracked.</p> <p>This occurs because both the code to deliver the activity content and the code to track clicks is included in one piece of code that is delivered to the page. If you browse to a different page and set up click tracking, then the activity content code and the click tracking code are delivered to that page. If the click-tracking page has a similar page structure to the page where the test is run, then the test content might also appear on the click-tracking page.</p> </td>
