# Activity Creation

Before you set up an activity that uses Analytics as the reporting source, establish the goal for the activity, such as improving revenue per visitor (RPV) or increasing clicks on your shopping cart. Choose a final success metric for the activity. Although you can select additional metrics at any time in Analytics, you must still specify a particular metric you expect this test to affect.
**Target Standard/Premium** 
Creating a Target Standard activity that uses Analytics as the reporting source is similar to setting up a regular Target Standard activity, with a few important differences. For example, you cannot select a segment for reporting while creating the activity because all segments available in Analytics can be applied when viewing a report.

>1. Click ** `Create Activity` **.


>       >[!NOTE]
>       >
>       >An activity name cannot include the "%" character if Analytics is used as the reporting source.

>1. Select the activity type and begin setting up the activity.
>1. When you get to the ** `Settings` ** portion of the activity creation flow, choose ** `Adobe Analytics` ** and specify your company.
>1. Select a report suite.

>       You can choose any report suite that is available to you in Adobe Analytics. The report suite defines where the collected data will be available. Virtual report suites are not included in the report suite list.
>       You might encounter two possible errors while selecting the report suite:
>    
>    * You get an error that no report suites are available, but your account is properly set up.
>      You might need to check your Analytics company. If your Marketing Cloud account is tied to more than one Analytics company, log out of Target, and log in to Analytics under the right company. Then return to Target, and the report suites will load.

>    * You don't see the report suite that you expect.
>      Only report suites that are provisioned to connect to Adobe Target will be available for selection. If you don't see the report suite(s) you expect, first try logging out and logging back in to the Adobe Marketing Cloud to try again.


>       If the report suite(s) is still missing from the list, please [contact Customer Care](r_problem.md#reference_ACA3391A00EF467B87930A450050077C). 
>1. Specify your tracking server.

>       See [Using an Analytics Tracking Server](t_analytics_tracking_server.md#task_72077BA7E93C4A65A715A18F32228823). 

>       >[!NOTE]
>       >
>       >If you use Adobe Analytics as your activity's reporting source, you do not need to specify a tracking server during activity creation if you are using `mbox.js` version 61 (or later) or `at.js` version 0.9.1 (or later). The `mbox.js` or `at.js` library automatically sends tracking server values to `Target`. During activity creation, you can leave the `Tracking Server` field empty on the `Goals &amp; Settings` page. 

>1. Define the experience..
>1. Specify the activity goal.

>       You are required to select a success metric to use as a goal for each test. Your activity goal is the conversion activity that signals a successful activity. It is best practice never to run a test without having a goal to improve in some specific way. You can choose any Analytics metric available in the Analytics metric selector.

>       >[!NOTE]
>       >
>       >You can send a custom Target-based metric to Analytics rather than relying only on Analytics data. For example, you can monitor clicking on a page, which is usually not tracked by Analytics. This custom metric is sent to Analytics automatically from the Target server, and appears as the "Target Conversion" metric in the metrics selector in Analytics. The Target Conversion metric is empty if you choose to use Analytics metrics.

>       Setting a goal doesn't mean you can't use another metric when evaluating test results. The goal is, however, a reminder of the one thing you want to improve with the activity.
>       The visitor remains in the activity after they reach the goal. The visitor continues to see activity content but is not counted as a new activity entry.

>       >[!NOTE]
>       >
>       >When setting up an activity after setting up Analytics as your reporting source, there is no option to set up audiences for reporting. Analytics segments are available in the Target Activities report.

>1. Click ** `Save` **.
