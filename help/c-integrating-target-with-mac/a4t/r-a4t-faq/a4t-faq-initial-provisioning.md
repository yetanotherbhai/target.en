# Initial provisioning - A4T FAQ{#initial-provisioning-a-t-faq}

This topic contains answers to questions that are frequently asked about provisioning Analytics as the reporting source for Target (A4T).

## How can I capture Analytics events across multiple pages and associate them with an A4T activity in Target?

To implement a basic multi-page A4T use-case:

* Implement both Target and Analytics (JavaScript libraries) on the activity landing page. This stitches the Target data with the Analytics data for each visitor. This data remains in Analytics until it expires. The default expiration is 90 days.

* For the rest of the pages on the site, where you only want to track the Analytics metrics, implement only Analytics on those pages. The Analytics metrics captured across those pages are automatically stitched to the Target activity the visitor initially landed on (based on the Target information attached to that visitor from the preceding bullet).

## How can I tell whether A4T is enabled on my Target account? {#section_4437D284448F4313BF953D4B6EDBACA6}

Before a report suite can be selected when defining an Analytics activity, you need both an Analytics user account and a Target user account. Your user accounts must be configured as described in the documentation. See [User Permission Requirements](../../../c-integrating-target-with-mac/a4t/account-reqs.md#concept_4BC06CAB00BF46FF9362AFE98656B083) .

Once you are a member of one or more Experience Cloud groups that have access to Analytics and Target and you have access to all report suites, you should see the option to create an A/B test using Analytics under **[!UICONTROL Create Activity]**.

If provisioning issues occur, check whether A4T is provisioned correctly.

## Why are my report suites not loading? {#section_6CC8B2B3568A46C499895EB9811FDC2E}

Check the following if any of these problems occur:

* Make sure your Analytics and Target accounts are linked in the Experience Cloud. 
* If you are using multiple Analytics company logins in the same Experience Cloud company, make sure that the last Analytics company you logged in to is the one that is tied to the Target account for the integration. 
* If you have been logged in to the Experience Cloud for several hours, sometimes the Analytics session can expire. Log out and log back in to try again.
