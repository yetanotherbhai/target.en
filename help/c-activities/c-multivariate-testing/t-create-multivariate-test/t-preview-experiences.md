# Preview experiences for a Multivariate Test{#preview-experiences-for-a-multivariate-test}

Because a multivariate test compares multiple experiences on a page, it is helpful to preview the page with each experience.

1. From the Experience Composer, click **[!UICONTROL Preview]**.

   A list of all experiences appears.

1. Click an experience in the list to view that experience.

1. To exclude an experience from the multivariate test, select that experience and click **[!UICONTROL Exclude]**.

   You might exclude an experience that shows conflicting variations or an experience that is not aesthetically balanced.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >When creating multivariate tests, you can now exclude more than 10 percent of experiences from the test, provided you acknowledge the warning that you must then use offline reporting for analysis.

   By default, all experiences are included in the multivariate test. To include an experience that has been excluded, select the excluded experience and click **[!UICONTROL Include]**. 

Click **[!UICONTROL Exit Preview Mode]** to return to the Experience Composer so you can make changes, or click **[!UICONTROL Continue]** to go to the test summary.
