# Click tracking{#click-tracking}

Target enables you to track clicks on any element as a success metric.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Tracking clicks is not supported on the target global mbox when it is used as a location in a form-based activity.

## Setting Up Click Tracking {#section_5540C5A533114E57BAE022A600B02E72}

1. When setting your goals on the [!UICONTROL Goals & Settings] page for your activity , select the **[!UICONTROL Conversion]** success metric. 
1. For the action, select **[!UICONTROL Clicked an element]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Select elements]**.

   Your page opens in the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC). 

1. Select any elements that you want to track.

   See the Considerations section below for tips on selecting elements. 

1. Click the check mark at the top of the screen to save your selections.

When an activity entrant clicks a selected element, that click is counted as a conversion.

## Considerations {#section_DD49EBA86CC5475E96BA87D2468FDB36}

There are several things to consider when selecting elements:

* The DOM path feature is available when setting up click tracking. When you click an element on the page, the VEC options menu displays. In addition, the corresponding DOM path displays at the bottom of the page. You can use the DOM path to quickly see information about the selected element (type, ID, and class) and move up or down the DOM path to select the desired element. 

  ![DOM path illustration](/help/c-activities/r-success-metrics/assets/click-tracking-dom.png)

  Just like when creating experiences in Step 1 in the activity-creation workflow, the DOM path selector at the bottom of the page lets you choose an element. On selecting an element from the DOM path, the corresponding element in the VEC displays as "Selected." To unselect a selected element, you can again click the element in the DOM path selector or click the "Selected" box within the VEC.

  For more information, see [Navigate elements using the DOM path](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/viztarget-options.md#dom-path) in *Visual Experience Composer Options*.

* You can browse to a different page to track clicks on a page where you might not be changing content. This different page must be included in the activity using the [multipage feature](../../c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/multipage-activity.md#concept_277E096063E14813AC5D8EDFA1D2ED48) and [!DNL at.js] or [!DNL mbox.js] must be implemented on it. 
* If you select more than one element, if an entrant clicks on any one of the chosen elements, the click is counted. To count each item separately, set up individual success metrics for each element. 
* Make sure you select the level of element you want to track. For example, when specifying a button, make sure you select the link and not the button text. 
* Click events are sent to [!DNL Target] on the same page as the click. 
* If the click-tracking metric is the Goal metric of an A4T activity, the visitor must click this element within 60 seconds of the page loading in order for the metric to track. 
* Click tracking does not work on elements that include escaped characters in their selectors, including the following:

  |  Character  | Description  |
  |---|---|
  |  #  | Number sign or Hash  |
  |  :  | Colon  |
  |  .  | Period  |
  |  $  | Dollar sign  |
  |  [ ]  | Square brackets  |

* If you use [!DNL at.js] click tracking and you also use Analytics AppMeasurement, [!DNL at.js] click tracking cancels all other click event handlers. As a result, the AppMeasurement click handler never executes.

[!DNL at.js] has special handling for click tracking when the underlying element is an `A` (link) tag or `FORM` tag.

  The following steps are executed by [!DNL at.js] when the click tracking event is attached to an `A` (link) tag or a `FORM` tag:

  1. Invoke `event.preventDefault()`.

  1. Fire Target request.

  1. On Target request success or error callback, execute default behavior:

     * `A` (link) tag: The default behavior is to navigate to the URL defined by HREF attribute. 
     * `FORM` tag: The default behavior is to submit the form.

  This default behavior might interfere with Analytics click tracking. If you are using Analytics, you should rely on Analytics for click tracking rather than Target.
