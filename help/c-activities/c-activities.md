## Activities List {#section_DE8E2DB30D534962A931EF8BB48240F5}

The [!UICONTROL Activities] list provides an overview of all activities.

The Activities list displays the following information:

<table id="table_4DB3713F5206493FBD57D30D8BD11E85">

Note the following details about the Activity list:

* Archived and ended activities do not appear in the [!UICONTROL Activities] list. To view these activities, filter them using the advanced filter settings on left rail. 
* As soon as an activity originally created in [!DNL Target Classic] is deactivated or deleted, it is deleted from [!DNL Target Standard/Premium]. Deleted activities originally created in [!DNL Target Classic] are not sent to the [!UICONTROL Archive] folder in [!DNL Target Standard/Premium]. The archived folder functionality applies only to activities created in [!DNL Target Standard/Premium]. 
* All activity types other than [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] (AP), [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate], and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] give you the choice to use either [!DNL Target] or [!DNL Adobe Analytics] as the data source. [!UICONTROL AP], [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate], and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target] *always* use [!DNL Target] data. 
* Activities are available to several channels:

    * Web and mobile sites 
    * Internet-connected screens and devices, including kiosks and ATMs 
    * Email and other acquisition channels or partner sites 
    * Mobile apps 
    * Anywhere else you can deliver tagged content

## Sorting and Filtering the Activities List {#section_41DAD479FFF740E2BB67BF4825955670}

By default, the list is sorted by the date the activity was last modified, with the most recent on top. However, there are several filtering options to help you customize the list to show the activities you want to see.

**Search**

Use the search field to search for activities that match your search criteria.

![](assets/activities_search.png)

The search field includes a drop-down menu to help you narrow your search by specifying one of the following search filters: [!UICONTROL Activity Name] and [!UICONTROL URL].

**Activity List Filters**

You can determine which activities appear in your Activities list by selecting list filters.

![](assets/activities_filters.png)

You can filter by the following options. In each category, if nothing is selected, the default is All.

<table id="table_7C6A39CDD9E84084BE59C92BE17E4254">

## Tips and Tricks {#section_F77F30A246A14B538D9363B7F3639F97}

Get the most out of Adobe Target by learning more about various features and see why you should give them a try. The Tips and Tricks feature provides links to videos, use-cases, blogs, documentation, and much more.

The Tips and Tricks feature displays periodically on the Activities list page. After you read or dismiss a tip, it does not display again until the next tip is available. You can optionally disable all tips from displaying by clicking the Help icon > [!UICONTROL Disable Tip of the Day].

![](assets/tip-disable.png)

## Limitations {#section_049D4684403A4E07B998067EB8E9BE56}

Each Target activity has the following content limitations:

<table id="table_2BC0CCAEA2E24A298298E8456BE92642"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Item </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Limit </th> 
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Unique selectors </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>300 </p> <p>if a selector is repeated in a different experience, it is counted once. However, if it is repeated in the same experience, it is counted again. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Offers in each experience </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>350 </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Click track selectors in metrics </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>50 </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Mboxes in metrics </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>50 </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Audiences and locations </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>50 </p> <p>Audiences and locations (mbox) combination should not be more than 50. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

If you exceed any of these limits, the activity cannot be saved.

Increasing the numbers of these items in your activity also increases the length of time it takes to synchronize the activity across Target.

For additional limits of the Visual Experience Composer, see [Visual Experience Composer Limitations](../c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/c-experience-composer-best-practices.md#section_F33C2EA27F2E417AA036BC199DD6C721).

## Attributes Imported into Target for Activities Updated Outside of Target {#section_802B0D174E6A44E1A96F404CA81AAE44}

If activities created in [!DNL Target] are updated from outside of [!DNL Target] (for example, via Adobe I/O), the following activity attributes are imported back into [!DNL Target]:

`thirdpartyId`

`startDate`

`endDate`

`status`

`priority`

`marketingCloudMetadata(remoteModifiedBy)`

This import job will run when the activities page is opened, with a maximum delay of ten minutes. (KB-1526)
