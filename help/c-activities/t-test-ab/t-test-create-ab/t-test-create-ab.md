1. Create any new experiences by changing the elements on the page.

   The [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] displays two tabs on the left side after you create a new activity: Experience A and Experience B. Experience A is the control experience. Your focus will be on the Experience B tab, which you can modify as desired. Experience B is the alternate experience you can add to your test. You can add multiple experiences to the test. You can also delete Experience A from the activity if you don't want to include a default site experience as an option.

   For more information about adding and modifying experiences in the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer], see [Add Experience](../../../c-activities/t-test-ab/t-test-create-ab/t-ab-add-experience.md#task_454646F2895242D3B92DC395A0CE1A00). To modify Experience B, start with Step 3. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Target]** at the top of the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] to move to the next step in the three-step guided workflow.

   The flow diagram opens.

   ![](assets/ab_flow.png)

   The flow diagram leads you through the steps of choosing the audience for the activity and setting up experiences. 
1. In the [!UICONTROL Audience] box, click the edit icon, then [select the audience](../../../c-activities/t-test-ab/t-test-create-ab/c-ab-audience.md#concept_A268236C1224451DB7844BF67F41A087) for your activity.

   By default, the audience is set to All Visitors. 1. Choose the percentage of qualifying visitors that you want to enter the activity.

   ![](assets/audperc.png)

   For example, you might limit entries to 50% of all visitors or 45% of your "Californians" audience. 
1. Set up your traffic allocation.

   You can show multiple experiences to the same audience. A diagram displays showing your selected audience and the experiences you've added to the activity.

   If you select **[!UICONTROL Manual]**, specify the percentage of entrants you want to see each experience. You can split the percentages evenly between all experiences, or specify higher or lower percentages for each experience. The total for all experiences must equal 100%.

   If you select **[!UICONTROL Auto-allocate to best experience]**, most activity entrants are automatically directed to higher-performing experiences. Some visitors are allocated to all experiences, to maintain exploration of experiences and to recognize changes in performance trends. See [Automated Traffic Allocation](../../../c-activities/automated-traffic-allocation/automated-traffic-allocation.md#concept_A1407678796B4C569E94CBA8A9F7F5D4).

   If you select **[!UICONTROL Auto-target to optimize]**, Target uses advanced machine learning algorithms to automatically target visitors with the best experience to maximize your goals.

   >This "First Look" offering is enabled for a few customers in this release for testing and feedback.

   For more information, see [Auto-Target to Optimize](../../../c-activities/c-auto-target-to-optimize.md#concept_67779E5B7F67427A97D7EA2A6FB919B3).

   You can also click **[!UICONTROL Add Experience]** to add another experience to the activity. 
1. When you are satisfied with your audience and experience choices, click **[!UICONTROL Next]** to move to the third step of the three-step guided workflow.
1. Specify the [goals and settings](../../../c-activities/t-test-ab/t-test-create-ab/r-ab-goals-and-settings.md#reference_B25389FD6F3A4989801E740364B089CC) for the activity.
