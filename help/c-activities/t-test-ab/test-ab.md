# A/B Test{#a-b-test}

A/B Testing compares two or more versions of your Web site content to see which version best improves your conversions during a pre-specified test period.

An A/B test (sometimes referred to as an A/B...N test) compares two or more versions of your Web site content to see which best lifts your conversions, sales, or other metrics you identify. Use an A/B test to compare changes to your page against your default page design to determine which experience produces the best results.

A/B tests are particularly useful when you have a clear hypothesis of ways to improve your page performance based on success metrics or alternative content delivery.

A/B tests are well-suited for large changes that might involve new layouts or drastically different treatments of the elements. If your test design does not easily break down into individual page elements, you should run an A/B test before a multivariate test.

When you set up your test, you can determine what percentage of visitors see each experience. For example, you might split traffic evenly between the control and a second experience, or you might test out a new, more risky experience by showing it to only 5% of your audience.

When the number of different experiences exceeds five and span two or more locations, it's a good idea to consider an [MVT test](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/mvt/) before running your A/B tests. The multivariate test shows which areas on the page are most likely to improve conversion. These are the locations that a marketer should focus on. For example, the MVT test might show that the call to action is the most important location for meeting your goals. Once you have determine which locations and content are most useful for helping you meet your goals, you can run an A/B test to further refine the results, such as to test two specific images against each other, or comparing the wording or colors of a call to action. By following an MVT test with one or more A/B tests, you can determine the best possible content for the results you desire.
