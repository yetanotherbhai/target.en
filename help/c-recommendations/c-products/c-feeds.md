# Feeds{#feeds}

Use feeds to get entities imported into Recommendations. Entities can be sent using CSV files, the Google Product Search feed format, and/or Adobe Analytics product classifications.

## Feeds Overview {#concept_D1E9C7347C5D4583AA69B02E79607890}

Use feeds to get entities imported into Recommendations. Entities can be sent using CSV files, the Google Product Search feed format, and/or Adobe Analytics product classifications. 

Feeds allow you to pass [Entities](../../c-recommendations/c-products/c-products.md#concept_FD935A24D98745FFB2447933FCEB8062) or augment your mbox data with information that is either unavailable on the page or is unsafe to send directly from the page, such as margin, COGS, and so on.

You can select which columns from your Adobe Target product classifications file or Google Product Search file you want to send to the [!DNL Recommendations] server. These pieces of data about each item can then be used in template display and for controlling recommendations.

If data is collected by both an entity feed and an mbox, the most recent data wins. Usually, the most recent data comes from an mbox, because it is viewed more often. In the rare event that entity feed data and mbox data hit at the same time, the mbox data is used.

The [!UICONTROL Feeds] list ( **[!UICONTROL Recommendations]** > **[!UICONTROL Feeds]**) provides information about any feeds you have created. To edit the name of a feed, you must edit the feed itself. When you save with the new name, the feed is refreshed.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the [!UICONTROL Last Updated] feed says "undefined," then the feed is coming in from [!DNL Recommendations Classic] and cannot be changed from within [!DNL Target Premium Recommendations].

## CSV {#section_65CC1148C7DD448FB213FDF499D35FCA}

You can create a `.csv` file using the Adobe proprietary CSV upload format. The file contains display information about the reserved and custom attributes for your products. To upload attributes specific to your implementation, replace `CustomN` in the header row with the name of the attribute you want to use. In the example below, `entity.Custom1` has been replaced by: `entity.availability`. You can then bulk upload the file to the [!DNL Recommendations] server.

Using the .csv format has the following advantages over the Google Feed format:

* It doesn't require field mappings. 
* It supports multi-value attributes (see example below). 
* It supports up to 100 custom attributes. If you need more than 100 custom attributes, you can create a second feed file with a different set of custom attributes specified.

Use the bulk upload method to send display information if you don't have mboxes on your page, or you want to supplement your display information with items that are not available on your site. For example, you might want to send inventory information that might not be published on your site.

Any data uploaded using the [!DNL .csv] file, Google product feed, or Analytics Product classification feed overwrites the existing entity attribute value in our database. If you send price information via mbox requests and then send different price values in the file, the values in the file overwrite the values set with the mbox request. An exception to this is the `categoryId` entity attribute where the category values are appended instead of being overwritten up to the 250-character limit.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Do not enclose values in double quotes ( " ) in your [!DNL .csv] file unless they are intentional. If you enclose values in double quotes you must escape them by enclosing them in another set of double quotes. Double quotes that are not escaped will prevent the recommendations feed from loading properly.

For example, the following syntax is incorrect:

`"Apples "Bananas" Grapes"",`

The following syntax is correct:

"Apples ""Bananas"" Grapes""",

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can't overwrite an existing value with a blank value. You have to pass another value in its place to overwrite it. In the case of sale price, a common solution is to either pass in an actual "NULL" or some other message. You can then write a template rule to exclude items with that value.

The product is available in the admin interface approximately two hours after successfully uploading its entity.

The following is sample code for a .csv file:

```
## RECSRecommendations Upload File 
## RECS''## RECS'' indicates a Recommendations pre-process header. Please do not remove these lines. 
## RECS 
## RECSUse this file to upload product display information to Recommendations. Each product has its own row. Each line must contain 19 values and if not all are filled a space should be left. 
## RECSThe last 100 columns (entity.custom1 - entity.custom100) are custom. The name 'customN' can be replaced with a custom name such as 'onSale' or 'brand'. 
## RECSIf the products already exist in Recommendations then changes uploaded here will override the data in Recommendations. Any new attributes entered here will be added to the product''s entry in Recommendations. 
## RECSentity.id,entity.name,entity.categoryId,entity.message,entity.thumbnailUrl,entity.value,entity.pageUrl,entity.inventory,entity.margin,entity.last_updated_by,entity.multi_english,entity.availability,entity.tax_country,entity.tax_region,entity.tax_rate,entity.product_type,entity.item_group_id,entity.color,entity.size,entity.brand,entity.gtin

## Google {#section_8EFA98B5BC064140B3F74534AA93AFFF}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The Google Product Search feed type uses the Google format. This is different from the Adobe proprietary CSV upload format.

If you have an existing Google product feed, then you can use that as your import file.

>[!NOTE]
>
>It is not required to use Google data. [!DNL Recommendations] just uses the same format as Google. You can use this method to upload any data you have, and use the available scheduling features. However, you must retain Google's predefined attribute names when you set up the file.

Most retailers upload products to Google, so when a visitor uses Google product search, their products will show up. [!DNL Recommendations] follows Google's specification exactly for entity feeds. Entity feeds can be sent to [!DNL Recommendations] via [!DNL .xml], [!DNL .txt], or [!DNL .tsv], and can use the [attributes defined by Google](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/188494?hl=en&topic=2473824&ctx=topic#US). The results are searchable on the [Google shopping pages](https://www.google.com/prdhp).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The POST method must be allowed on the server that is hosting the Google feed content.

Because [!DNL Recommendations] users already configure [!DNL .xml] or [!DNL .txt] feeds to send to Google either via URL or FTP, entity feeds accept that product data and use it to build out the recommendations catalog. Specify where that feed exists and the recommendations server retrieves the data.

If you use Google Product Search for the entity feed upload, you still need to have a product page mbox on the page if you want to show recommendations there or track product views for algorithm delivery based on views.

Google feeds do not support multiple values for a custom attribute.

The feed runs at the time you save and activate it. It runs at the time you save the feed, then every day an hour later.

The following is sample code for a Google Product Search feed .xml file:

```

## Analytics Product Classifications {#section_79E430D2C75443BEBC9AA0916A337E0A}

The Analytics Product classification is the only classification available for recommendations. For more information about this classification file, see [Classifications](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/reference/classifications.html) in the *Analytics Help and Reference* guide. It's possible that not all the information you need for recommendations will be available in your current implementation, so follow this user guide if you want to add to your classifications file.

## Create Feed {#task_C6CD9EA905744C2CA0BB8259BB74C867}

Create a feed to insert information about your products or services into [!DNL Recommendations].

<!-- 

recs/t_feeds_create.xml

 -->

1. From within the Target interface, click **[!UICONTROL Recommendations]** > **[!UICONTROL Feeds]** > **[!UICONTROL Create Feed]**.

   ![Step Result](assets/CreateFeed.png)

1. Specify a descriptive name for your feed.
1. Select a **[!UICONTROL Source Type]**.

   For information about Google Product Feed and CSV feed types, see [Feeds Overview](../../c-recommendations/c-products/c-feeds.md#concept_D1E9C7347C5D4583AA69B02E79607890). 
1. Specify a Report Suite, or the URL or FTP location where the feed can be accessed.

   If you select FTP, provide the FTP server information, the login credentials, the filename, and the FTP directory. You have the option to use FTP with SSL (FTPS) for more secure uploads.

   If you select URL, specify the URL. 
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Next]** arrow to display the [!UICONTROL Schedule] options.

   ![Step Result](assets/CreateFeedSchedule.png)

1. Select an update option:

* Daily 
* Weekly 
* Every 2 Weeks 
* Never

  Do not schedule an update. Choose this if you do not want this feed to run.

1. Specify the time you want your feed to run.

   This option is based on the time zone used in your browser. If you want to use a time in a different time zone, you must calculate that time according to your time zone. 
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Next]** arrow to display the [!UICONTROL Mapping] options, then specify how you want to map your data to [!DNL Target] definitions.

   ![Step Result](assets/CreatFeedMapping.png)

1. (Optional) If you want the feed to belong to an environment (host group), select the host group.

   By default the feed belongs to all host groups. This ensures that items in this feed are available in any environment.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >For more information, see [Hosts](../../administrating-target/c-hosts.md#concept_516BB01EBFBD4449AB03940D31AEB66E).

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
>After you create or edit a feed, the feed runs immediately, then will update according to the parameters you set. It takes some time for all the information to be available. First, the feed must sync, then it must be processed and indexed before it can be published and made available. The current status appears under [Feed Status](../../c-recommendations/c-products/c-feeds.md#concept_E475986720D1400999868B3DFD14A7A0) in the Feeds list. You can close [!DNL Target] before the process is complete and the process continues. 
>
>While indexing is in progress, products and feed headers appear before individual values have been indexed. This enables you to search and see products so you can create collections, exclusions, designs, and activities before indexing has been completed. 
>
>When the Status says "Success," it means that the file was found and it parsed correctly. The information is not available to use within [!DNL Recommendations] until the file is indexed, which can take some time, depending on the size of your file. If the process fails, it means that the file was not found (for example, you used an incorrect URL or your FTP information was incorrect), or that there was a parsing error.
