What you need to know before creating a Recommendations activity.

## Plan and Implement Recommendations {#concept_02AA644A4C7D4D5CB1D9CADA208CF8D1}

What you need to know before creating a [!DNL Recommendations] activity. 

[!DNL Recommendations] requires that you set up the following hierarchy of information:

<table id="table_53E0DEF7F0204F9F9C8C8928D55B049E"> 
 <thead>

## Base Implementation {#concept_D1154A3FB0FB4467A29AD2BDD21C82D5}

The base implementation requires that you pass parameters to your page that determine which products or services appear in your recommendations.

<!-- 

recs/c_base_implementation.xml

 -->

Before you begin setting up a [!DNL Recommendations] activity, you should understand how product data is provided to [!DNL Recommendations], and decide which method works best for your needs.

There are two methods to provide information about products and services to [!DNL Recommendations]:

<table id="table_FCC3159B51BF43FA92F3658EDF7C7E1F"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Method </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Description </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Pass parameters directly to the page </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>This method works well for items that change frequently. However, because it requires that changes be made directly to the page, in many organizations, this method requires the involvement of IT and the people who implement the pages. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Pass parameters through a Google or CSV feed </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>This method works well for collections that do not change frequently. It is usually not necessary to change your mbox implementation or other page code to provide product information through a feed. However, the product list remains static, so quick changes are more difficult. For more information, see <a href="../c-recommendations/c-products/c-feeds.md#concept_1228B31E3D0B483B9DD42C5E2AE436E3" format="dita" scope="local"> Feeds </a>. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

These methods can be used separately or together, as in the following examples.

## Example One: Combine Page and Feeds {#section_DF6BAE4BF11548BD9C44D0A426BCF5A7}

One common [!DNL Recommendations] implementation option uses both page parameters and feeds.

This method might be preferred by a retailer who has a relatively set product catalog, but who might want to emphasize specific seasonal items or items that are on sale. Most customers might provide their information primarily through the feed, with only occasional adjustments on the page.

Use a feed to provide information that will remain static. Whether using a CSV file or Google feed, use the following parameters:

* Required parameters

    * `entity.id`

* Helpful parameters

    * `entity.cust1` 
    * `entity.cust2` 
    * `entity.cust3` 
    * All other attributes

Once the feed is set up and passed to [!DNL Recommendations], pass parameters on the page for items that are frequently changing.

* Required parameters

    * `entity.id` 
    * `entity.categoryId`

* Helpful parameters

    * `entity.inventory` 
    * `entity.value`

Priority is given to whichever set of data runs most recently. If you pass the feed first and then update the page parameters, changes that are made in the page parameters will be shown, replacing item information passed in the feed.

## Example Two: Pass All Parameters on the Product (or Content) Details Page {#section_D5A4F69457604CA7AACFD7BFF79B58A9}

If you pass all parameters on the page, you can quickly make updates by updating the page. In some organizations, this requires the involvement of IT or your Web Design team.

This example might be especially useful for a media company, with content that constantly changes.

* Required parameters

    * `entity.id` 
    * `entity.categoryId` 
    * All other attributes

## Sample Code {#section_6E8A73376F30468BB549F337C4C220B1}

For example, you can use the following code in the header section of your product or content pages:

```
function targetPageParams() { 
   return { 
      "entity": { 
         "id": " 
<i>32323</i>", 
         "categoryId": " 
<i>My Category</i>", 
         "value": 105.56, 
         "inventory": 329 
      } 
   } 
}
```

For more examples of the code you might use on different types of pages, see [Implementation According to Page Type](../c-recommendations/c-plan-implement.md#reference_DE38BB07BD3C4511B176CDAB45E126FC). 

## Implementation According to Page Type {#reference_DE38BB07BD3C4511B176CDAB45E126FC}

Page type will influence your [!DNL Recommendations] implementation.

<!-- 

recs/r_implementation_page_type.xml

 -->

For example, the types of recommendations you want to present may be different on a product page than on a category page or your home page. For each page, you can run specific functions prior to the mbox call to display the appropriate recommendations.

For information about the attributes in the examples, see [Entity Attributes](../c-recommendations/c-products/r-entity-attributes.md#reference_3BCC1383FB3F44F4A2120BB36270387F).

Valid JSON formatting is required.

The `targetPageParams` function shown below is especially helpful if you are using a tag management solution to implement your pages. [!DNL Adobe Launch] or [!DNL Adobe Dynamic Tag Manager] (DTM) places the at.js/mbox.js reference and the `targetPageParams` function on your page and allows you to configure the values. You should either place that function before your at.js/mbox.js call, or put it in the Extra JavaScript section of your at.js/mbox.js.

## All Pages {#section_A22061788BAB42BB82BA087DEC3AA4AD}

All pages that contain recommendations require either an [!DNL at.js] or [!DNL mbox.js] reference on the page. Add one of the following references to all pages with recommendations:

```
<script src="../at.js /></script>
```

```
<script src="../mbox.js /></script>
```

This implementation requires:

* [!DNL at.js] version 0.9.2 (or later) or [!DNL mbox.js] version 55 (or later) 

* [!DNL mbox.js] must include the reference to [!DNL target.js] ( [!DNL at.js] does not require a reference to [!DNL target.js])

For more information about implementing [!DNL at.js], see [How to Deploy at.js](../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/how-to-deployatjs.md#topic_ECF2D3D1F3384E2386593A582A978556).

For more information about implementing [!DNL mbox.js], see [Mbox.js Implementation](../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/t-mbox-download/t-mbox-download.md#task_4EAE26BB84FD4E1D858F411AEDF4B420).

For more information about the differences between the two Target Javascript libraries, see [Understanding the Target JavaScript Libraries](../c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/c-target-implement.md#concept_60B748DE4293488F917E8F1FA4C7E9EB).

## Category Page {#section_F51A1AAEAC0E4B788582BBE1FEC3ABDC}

On a category page, you probably want to restrict your recommendations to products or content within that category. To set up a category page, you set up the keys used by the page. For more information about keys, see [Base the Recommendation on a Recommendation Key](../c-recommendations/c-algorithms/t-create-new-algorithm.md#task_2B0ED54AFBF64C56916B6E1F4DC0DC3B).

```
function targetPageParams() { 
   return { 
      "entity": { 
         "categoryId": " 
<i>My Category</i>" 
      } 
   } 
}
```

## Product Page {#section_205B3953C9664125A17CA8574FA6B2A3}

On a product page, you might want to recommend specific items, or items with a particular price or inventory level. For a product page, you might need to set up frequently changing attributes (such as value and inventory), in addition to the keys required for a category page.

```
function targetPageParams() { 
   return { 
      "entity": { 
         "id": " 
<i>32323</i>", 
         "categoryId": " 
<i>My Category</i>", 
         "value": 105.56, 
         "inventory": 329 
      } 
   } 
}
```

## Cart Page {#section_D37E48700F074556B925D0CA0291405E}

On a cart page, you likely want to exclude some items from your recommendations, such as the items that are already in the cart.

```
<script type="text/javascript"> 
function targetPageParams() { 
   return { 
      "excludedIds": [352, 223, 23432, 432, 553] 
      } 
} 
</script>
```

## Thank You Page {#section_C6126A4517A1478693AB7EC2A1D4ACCA}

On the Thank You page, you might want to show the order total, and the order ID, and show the products that were purchased, without recommending additional items. You can implement a second mbox to capture the order information.

* If you are using at.js, see [Track Conversions](../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/implementing-target-without-a-tag-manager.md#task_E85D2F64FEB84201A594F2288FABF053). 
* If you are using mbox.js, see [Create an Order Confirmation mbox - mbox.js](../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/t-mbox-download/t-orderconfirm-create.md#task_0036D5F6C062442788BB55E872816D82).

## Settings {#concept_C1E1E2351413468692D6C21145EF0B84}

Use settings to manage your [!DNL Recommendations] implementation.

<!-- 

recs/c_setup.xml

 -->

To access the [!UICONTROL Recommendations Settings] options, open [!DNL Target] in the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud], then click **[!UICONTROL Recommendations]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings]**.
