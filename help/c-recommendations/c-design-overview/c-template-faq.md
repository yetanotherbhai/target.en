# ![PREMIUM](/help/assets/premium.png) Design FAQ {#design-faq}

List of frequently asked questions (FAQs) about recommendations designs.

## Why isn't category showing in the design? I'm using $entity1.categoryId. {#section_073309B8051049C7953D396A93EA0713}

Category ID can't be displayed in the design. Because multiple categories can be stored, the system wouldn't know which category to display.

## How should I change a design to get an instant update? {#section_28EE35A5B10B47ECA4A332F0E5B2598F}

Altering the design that is currently in use takes a while to update. To change the design instantly, create a new design, select it in the campaign, and save the recommendation.

## How can I capture key information for display in the design? Example: If we want to display the key product's category, how would I code that value in the velocity design? {#section_F08043B14BA24BC8815FEF25F4F84C39}

The `$key. *`value`*` parameter captures most of the key product's information to display within the design. Example: If you want to display the key product's thumbnail, you would use `$key.thumbnailURL`.

## Which version of Velocity is used? {#section_28F00E15A4A54A768782A3F5BB0CDB21}

Version 1.7 with no additional tools or libraries added in. Basic Velocity functionality is available.

## How do I replace an existing entity value with a blank? For example, an item's entity.message needs to be cleared when a promotion ends. {#section_B88F2C2925DC4508974B2F8B13F961CB}

Sending in a JavaScript nonbreaking space seems to do this. Have the developers send in `\u00A0` as the value. Example: `entity.message=\u00A0`.You might consider having that be the default value when no value is present instead of a null.

## Can I use a profile script in a Recommendations design? {#section_6BD55203984A4D80A0C6F241AD7806DF}

Yes. However, you must add a backslash (\) before the $ in the profile script name.
