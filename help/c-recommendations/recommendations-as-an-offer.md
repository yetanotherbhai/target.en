# ![PREMIUM](/help/assets/premium.png) Recommendations as an offer

You can now include recommendations inside [!UICONTROL A/B Test] (including [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate] and [!UICONTROL Auto-Target]) and [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] (XT) activities. 

This functionality opens up entirely new capabilities, such as:

* Test and target recommendations and non-recommendations content within the same activity.
* Easily experiment with placement of recommendations on the page, including the order of multiple recommendations.
* Automatically push traffic to the best-performing recommendations experience using [!UICONTROL Auto-Allocate].
* Dynamically assign visitors to tailored recommendations experiences based on their profile using [!UICONTROL Auto-Target].

To get started, create an [!UICONTROL A/B Test] or [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting] activity using the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] and use the [!UICONTROL Insert Before], [!UICONTROL Insert After], or [!UICONTROL Replace With] action to add recommendations to an experience.

## Add a recommendation as an offer in an A/B Test or XT activity

1. Start the three-step guided workflow using the Visual Experience Composer (VEC) to create an [A/B Test](/help/c-activities/t-test-ab/t-test-create-ab/test-create-ab.md) or [Experience Targeting](/help/c-activities/t-experience-target/t-xt-create/xt-create.md) (XT) activity.
  
   >[!NOTE]

   >For A/B Tests, remember that you can choose the [Auto-Allocate](/help/c-activities/automated-traffic-allocation/automated-traffic-allocation.md) option to automatically push traffic to the best-performing recommendations or the [Auto-Target](/help/c-activities/auto-target-to-optimize.md) option to assign visitors to tailored recommendations experiences based on their profile.

While creating an [experience](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/viztarget-options.md), click the element you want to add a recommendation to as an offer, select the [!UICONTROL Insert Before], [!UICONTROL Insert After], or [!UICONTROL Replace With] action, then select [!UICONTROL Recommendation].
