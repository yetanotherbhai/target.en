# ![PREMIUM](/help/assets/premium.png) Recommendations Activity settings{#recommendations-activity-settings}

Information about the settings you can use to describe and control a [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activity.

The following sections describe the available settings for a [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activity.

## Name

Provide a descriptive name that will help you and your team identify the activity.

The following characters are not allowed in an activity name:

`/`
`?`
`#`
`:`
`=`
`+`
`-`
`@`

If you specify a [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activity name that already exists for another activity in [!UICONTROL Recommendations Classic], the new activity is resynced with a new name. The new name is the original name appended with a timestamp to make it unique. This new name is displayed in both Target Standard/Premium and [!UICONTROL Recommendations Classic].

## Objective

(Optional) Describe the goal of the activity.

## Priority

Adjust the slider to determine the priority level. There are three levels:

*   0 = Low
*   1 = Medium
*   2 = High

The priority is used if multiple activities are assigned to the same location with the same audience. If two or more activities are assigned to the location, the activity with the highest priority displays.

## Duration

Set the duration of the activity.

The activity can start when approved, or you can set a specific date and time. Likewise, the activity can either end when it is deactivated or you can set a date and time. The time picker uses a 24-hour clock, with 00:00 being midnight. The time zone is set to the time zone configured in your browser. To use a different time zone, set your browser to another time zone and restart the browser.

## Reporting Settings

* **Goal:** Name the goal, and select the success metric that determines whether the activity is successful.
