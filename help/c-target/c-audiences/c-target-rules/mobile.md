# Mobile{#mobile}

Target mobile devices based on parameters such as mobile device, type of device, device vendor, screen dimensions (by pixels), and more.

For example, you might want to show different content to users who enter your page from a phone than you would if they visit from a computer. In that case, you could select the Mobile audience, then select the **[!UICONTROL Is Mobile Phone]** option, then add any specific details that are important to you, such as the type of phone, size of the screen (in pixels), and so on.

Mobile targeting is delivered by [DeviceAtlas](https://deviceatlas.com/device-data/user-agent-tester), a service of DotMobi. DeviceAtlas is a comprehensive database of mobile devices built on data compiled from numerous sources, including manufacturers and network operators. This data is then verified, cross-referenced, and validated to build a large and accurate mobile device database available.

Device detection is accomplished by analyzing User-Agent strings. Some device manufacturers, such as Apple, disable this functionality by not providing enough information in the UA.

For example, Apple devices don't share device model-specific tokens in the UA. The result is that it is not possible to detect iPhone models (such as iPhone 5S, iPhone SE, iPhone 6, and so forth) using a simple keyword-based method.

To solve this, Target collects additional data to accurately detect iPhones and other Apple devices using the following parameters:

   <td colname="col3"> <p>The device and the browser's JavaScript engine support Device Orientation. Can be Landscape or Portrait. </p> </td>

>Customers using the Mobile SDK do not need to do anything to leverage this functionality. Customers using at.js must [upgrade to at.js version 1.5.0](../../../c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/target-atjs-versions.md#reference_DBB5EDB79EC44E558F9E08D4774A0F7A) (or later).

You can choose more than one mobile device property. Multiple selections are joined with an OR.

Customers who are using a custom integration (not using at.js or the Mobile SDK) can collect these parameters themselves and pass them as mbox parameters.
