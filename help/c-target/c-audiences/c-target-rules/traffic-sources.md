# Traffic Sources{#traffic-sources}

Target visitors based on the search engine or landing page that refers them to your site.

For example, you can target based on the visitor's browser, search engine, or the referring landing page. The referring landing page is the page you clicked from to reach the current site this session. (For example, if you click an ad on Google and it leads you to the [!DNL adobe.com] home page, the referring landing page is [!DNL google.com].)

You can combine multiple traffic sources to create a complex targeting rule.

1. In the [!DNL Target] interface, click **[!UICONTROL Audiences]** > **[!UICONTROL Create Audience]**. 
1. Name the audience. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Rule]** > **[!UICONTROL Traffic Sources]**.
