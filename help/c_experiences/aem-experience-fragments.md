## Overview {#section_95A91830530F493B81C5C9CDB9B783EA}

Using experience fragments created in AEM in Target activities lets you combine the ease-of-use and power of AEM with powerful Automated Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities in Target to test and personalize experiences at scale.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 

AEM brings together all of your content and assets in a central location to fuel your personalization strategy. AEM lets you easily create content for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices in one location without writing code. There’s no need to create pages for every device—AEM automatically adjusts each experience using your content. 

Target lets you deliver personalized experiences at scale based on a combination of rules-based and AI-driven machine learning approaches that incorporate behavioral, contextual, and offline variables.&amp;nbsp; With Target you can easily set up and run A/B and Multivariate (MVT) activities to determine the best offers, content, and experiences. 

Experience fragments represent a huge step forward to link the content/experience creators and managers to the optimization and personalization professionals who are driving business outcomes using Target.

## Using Experiment Fragments in Target Activities {#section_17CE4BE6B2B74CCEBAE0C68DEB84ABB9}

After performing the preceding tasks, the experience fragment displays on the [!UICONTROL  Offers] page in Target. 


>[!NOTE]
>
>Target currently looks for experience fragments to import every ten minutes. The imported experience fragment should be available in Target within ten minutes, but this time frame should shorten going forward.




>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The experience fragment is currently imported into Target as an HTML offer. Note that the experience fragment "master" version remains in AEM. You cannot edit the experience fragment in Target.



You can hover over an experience fragment in the list, then click the View icon (  ![](../assets/icon_info.png) ) to see additional information about the experience fragment, including its public offer delivery URL, its AEM path, and a deep link to open the experience fragment inside of AEM. 

You can consume Experience Fragments in Target activities using the Visual Experience Composer (VEC) or the Form-Based Experience Composer. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>To fully utilize Target's AI and ML functionality, you can select[ Auto-Allocate ](../c_activities/automated_traffic_allocation.md#concept_A1407678796B4C569E94CBA8A9F7F5D4) or [ Automated Personalization ](../c_activities/t_automated_personalization.md#task_8AAF837796D74CF893CA2F88BA1491C9) while creating an A/B Test. 

**To consume Experience Fragments using the VEC:**

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The [!UICONTROL  Swap with Experience Fragment] option is not available for images. If you want to use this option with an image, click the container element that contains the desired image. 


   The [!UICONTROL  Experience Fragment] list displays all of the content created in AEM that is now natively available from within Target.
