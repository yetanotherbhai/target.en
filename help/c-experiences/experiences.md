# Experiences and offers{#experiences-and-offers}

An experience determines which content displays when the visitor meets the audience criteria for an activity.

An experience can be an offer, image, text, button, video, combination of these various elements on a page, an entire web page, or a set of pages that perhaps form a purchase funnel or some other logical sequence of pages. It can also be the response of a voice assistant, a customer service script, or even a personalized flavor from a drink machine. You test or personalize experiences in [!DNL Target] activities.

An activity typically contains more than one experience. For example, visitors from the Salt Lake City area might see an offer for a $30 discount on ski boots, while visitors from San Diego see an offer for a discount on wet suits. Or, you might test a page with different special offers for returning visitors. Each of these offers is presented in a separate experience.

Target provides the following experience composers:
