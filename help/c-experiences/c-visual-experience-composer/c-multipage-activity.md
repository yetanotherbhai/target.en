# Multipage Activity{#multipage-activity}

A multipage activity enables you to create a story over multiple pages, with a design that is specific to each page.

For example, you might want to test an offer for free shipping with purchases above a certain amount. You might want that offer to appear on your landing page, a category page, and certain product pages, but you want it to be a different size and in a different location on each page type. You could display a prominent offer on your home page, then reinforce that offer with smaller offers on other relevant pages.

You can also use a multipage activity to define different layouts for your desktop and non-responsive mobile sites. If the site has a separate mobile site like [!DNL m.mysite.com] instead of [!DNL `www.mysite.com`], you should instead create a [multipage activity](../../c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/c-multipage-activity.md#concept_277E096063E14813AC5D8EDFA1D2ED48), add [!DNL m.mysite.com] as separate pages, and then apply mobile editing to make appropriate changes on the desktop version and mobile version in the same experience. For responsive mobile sites, use [mobile experience editing](../../c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/c-mobile-viewports.md#concept_8E45527C4ABC41D59AA3553BEDC76FA5).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Multipage activities are designed for activities where the same offer has a different appearance on multiple pages. If the offer appears the same on all pages, a [template test](../../c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/t-temtest.md#task_2539D51A18044F82B0D9895636546781) is more efficient.

You can specify template rules for each page in the multipage test. For example, you can run a multipage test across the home page and all category pages by applying template rules to the category page in the multipage test. See [Include the Same Experience on Similar Pages](../../c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/t-temtest.md#task_2539D51A18044F82B0D9895636546781).

To add pages to a test:

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Configure]** gear icon. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Additional Pages]**.

   A navigation bar appears on the left of the screen.

1. Use that navigational bar to specify your pages and to set the default page.

   Click **[!UICONTROL Add Page]** to add an additional page.

   Click the three vertical ellipses icon to display an action menu:

   Use this menu to rename the pages, perform a redirect test from within the multipage activity or delete the page. 

1. Use the Visual Experience Composer to design the way the offer looks on each page.
