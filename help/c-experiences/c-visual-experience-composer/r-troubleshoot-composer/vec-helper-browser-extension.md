# Visual Experience Composer helper extension

The [!DNL Adobe Target] [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC) Helper browser extension for Google Chrome can be used to reliably load websites that might otherwise be problematic.

Reasons why some websites might not open reliably in the VEC include:

* The website has strict security policies.
* The website is in an iframe.
* The at.js library is not yet implemented on the website.
* The customer's QA and/or stage site is not available to the outside world (the site is internal).

The VEC Helper browser extension for Chrome solves site-loading issues for which customers now rely on the [!DNL Target] [!UICONTROL Enhanced Experience Composer] or third-party extensions, such as Requestly

Benefits of using the VEC Helper extension include the following:

* All iframe busting headers, such as X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy, are implicitly removed from the website. There is no more need to create complicated Requestly rules to do this.
* If a webpage does not yet contain the [!DNL Target] at.js JavaScript library, you can use the extension to inject the library so you can author experiences for the website. You can then create activities and QA them using preview links.
* Mobile Viewports are supported even without the [!UICONTROL Enhanced Experience Composer] (EEC).
* Customers new to [!DNL Target] can use the extension to experiment with [!DNL Target] even if their IT developers have not yet implemented [!DNL Target] on their websites.
* Partners servicing multiple customers' websites and [!DNL Target] accounts now have one simple mechanism to support VEC loading, instead of managing multiple rules in third-party tools.

## Obtain and install the VEC Helper browser extension

1. Navigate to the [Adobe Target VEC Helper browser extension in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adobe-target-vec-helper/ggjpideecfnbipkacplkhhaflkdjagak).
1. Click [!UICONTROL Add to Chrome > Add Extension].
1. To use the extension, click the VEC Helper browser extension icon ( ![VEC Helper icon](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/assets/vec-help-extension.png) ) in your Chrome browser's toolbar while in the VEC or [QA Mode](/help/c-activities/c-activity-qa/activity-qa.md).

## Notes

* Your implementation must use the [!DNL Target] at.js library. You cannot use an mbox.js implementation with the extension.
* The [!UICONTROL Inject Target libraries] flag in the extension is OFF by default. You can enable this flag if you want to use the VEC on a site that has not yet been implemented for [!DNL Target].

  Be aware that this flag is a global setting. The flag is enabled or disabled for all websites opened in the VEC. So, for example, if you set this flag to ON and open a website that is already implemented with at.js, you'll receive a message informing you that at.js is already loaded. We anticipate that most customers will already have at.js implemented on their pages and will use the default setting of OFF.

* The extension loads the latest version of at.js that is available from the [!DNL Target UI] io [UICONTROL Setup > Implementation].
* When using the extension to inject at.js while in [QA Mode](/help/c-activities/c-activity-qa/activity-qa.md), you must have another Chrome tab open. This Chrome tab must be authenticated to the same [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] Organization in which you created the activity.
* The following messages help keep you informed:

  * If you attempt to load a website using the VEC that fails to load, a message displays suggesting that you install the VEC Helper browser extension.
  * If at.js is not yet implemented on the website, a message displays in the VEC suggesting that you install the extension.
  * If the extension is enabled and is powering the loading, messages display when the extension injects the at.js library (if necessary) or helps open the website reliably within the VEC.
