# Create a Recommendations Activity


>1. Click ** [!UICONTROL  Create Activity] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Recommendations] **.

>       ![](../assets/Menu_CreateActivity.png) 
>1. Specify an activity URL, and then click ** [!UICONTROL  Next] **.


>       >[!NOTE]
>       >
>       >[!DNL  Target] does not differentiate between URL protocols ( [!DNL  https] and [!DNL  http]). As a result, [!DNL  https://adobe.com] and [!DNL  http://adobe.com] both match. 


>       The activity URL is the page where the recommendations will be displayed. 

>       ![](../assets/DB_NewRecAct.png) 

>       If you prefer to use the form-based Experience Composer, select that option. See [ Form-Based Experience Composer](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/target/target/t_form_experience_composer.html). 

>       When you click [!UICONTROL  Next], the VEC opens and shows your page. You can replace a current element with recommendations, or insert recommendations. 

>       For troubleshooting information about the VEC, should you have problems, see [ Troubleshooting the Visual Experience Composer](r_troubleshoot_composer.md#reference_77743144F10143A3A89D56E116D296E4). 
>1. Click an element on your page, then if recommendations are available where that element is located, click either ** [!UICONTROL  Replace w/ Recommendations] ** or ** [!UICONTROL  Insert Recommendations] ** before or after the selected element.

>       ![](../assets/Menu_Replace-Insert.png) 

>       Replacing an element with recommendations deletes the current content and replaces it with your recommendations. 
>1. Select a page type.

>       ![](../assets/Menu_PageType.png) 
>1. Select one or more criteria.

>       Criteria are displayed as cards that show information about each criteria. By default, the [!UICONTROL  Select Criteria] screen displays criteria that are compatible with your industry vertical and the page type you selected. You can change these options to display other criteria. 


>       >[!NOTE]
>       >
>       >Not every criteria will run correctly on every page. The page or mbox must pass in ` entity.id` or ` entity.categoryId` for current item/current category recommendations to be compatible. In general, it is best to show only compatible criteria. However, if you want incompatible criteria to be available for the activity, clear the ** [!UICONTROL  Compatible] ** check box. The [!UICONTROL  Compatible] option might not display, depending on your Recommendations settings ( ** [!UICONTROL  Recommendations] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Settings] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Filter Incompatible Criteria] **). For more information, see [ Settings](c_setup.md#concept_C1E1E2351413468692D6C21145EF0B84). 


>       ![](../assets/SCRN_SelectCriteria2.png) 

>       If you select multiple criteria, traffic is split evenly between the selected criteria. For example, if you have selected two criteria and your activity is designed to display default content to 20% of activity entrants, then 40% of activity entrants will see the recommendations controlled by each criteria. There is no option to change the percentages for each criteria. 
>    
>    * To search for an existing criteria (for example, if a large number of criteria cards are displayed), type in the search field until the desired criteria appears, then select the criteria and click ** [!UICONTROL  Done] **. 

>      Some criteria are supplied with [!DNL  Recommendations]. You and your team can also create your own custom criteria. 

>    * To create a new criteria, click ** [!UICONTROL  Create New] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Create Criteria] **, then fill in the information for the new criteria. For information about creating new criteria, see [ Creating Criteria](t_create_new_algorithm.md#task_8A9CB465F28D44899F69F38AD27352FE). 

>    * You can also group criteria into sequences. To create a new criteria sequence, click ** [!UICONTROL  Create New] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Create Criteria Sequence] **. See [ Creating Criteria Sequences](t_create_criteria_sequence.md#task_8A9CB465F28D44899F69F38AD27352FE) for more information. 

>1. Click ** [!UICONTROL  Next] **.
>1. Select a design.

>       A design is a template that determines the look of the locations on your page. [!DNL  Target] includes several preconfigured designs. You can also create your own custom designs. For more information, see [ Create a Design](t_create_design.md#task_CC5BD28C364742218C1ACAF0D45E0E14) and [ Customizing a Design](c_customizing_a_template.md#concept_94F1554C3F2E4CDB9A2C3D78F10EDA59). 

>       ![](../assets/Card_SelectDesign.png) 

>       Each design shows a graphical representation of how it will look, and icons that show how many of your live and inactive activities currently use that design. 

>    
>    * To select one or more existing designs, click the designs, then click ** [!UICONTROL  Done] **. 

>      If you selected multiple criteria, you can only select one design. 

>    * To create a custom design, click ** [!UICONTROL  Create New] **, then fill in the name and code for the new design. Click ** [!UICONTROL  Next] **, then select or upload an image and click ** [!UICONTROL  Done] ** > ** [!UICONTROL  Done] **. For information about creating a new design, see [ Create a Design](t_create_design.md#task_CC5BD28C364742218C1ACAF0D45E0E14).

>1. Click ** [!UICONTROL  Save] **.

>       The VEC screen displays the recommendation design on your page. 
>1. (Optional) Click ** [!UICONTROL  Preview] ** to see how the activity will appear to visitors.

>    
>    * Change the audience that will see the recommendations 


>      >[!NOTE]
>      >
>      >In addition to selecting an existing audience, you can[ create an activity-only audience](creating-activity-only-audience.md#concept_A6BADCF530ED4AE1852E677FEBE68483) or [ combine multiple audiences](c_combining-multiple-audiences.md#concept_A7386F1EA4394BD2AB72399C225981E5) to create ad hoc audiences rather than creating a new audience. 


>      By default, all users see the recommendations. However, you can target recommendation to a specific audience. 

>      For a [!DNL  Recommendations] activity, the control group sees the page without any recommendations. 

>    * View the criteria 

>    * Change the collection (next to the [!UICONTROL  Criteria] label)

>       >[!NOTE]
>       >
>       >If you specify a [!DNL  Recommendation] activity name that already exists for another activity in [!DNL  Recommendations Classic], the new activity is re-synced with a new name. The new name is the original name appended with a timestamp to make it unique. This new name is displayed in both [!DNL  Target Standard/Premium] and [!DNL  Recommendations Classic]. 

>1. When finished, click ** [!UICONTROL  Save] **.

>       An overview of your activity is displayed. From the [!UICONTROL  Overview] page, you can: 

>
