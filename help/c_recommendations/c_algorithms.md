# Criteria

## Criteria {#concept_4BD01DC437F543C0A13621C93A302750}
>Criteria are rules that determine which products to recommend based on a predetermined set of visitor behaviors.Criteria determine which action will result in which recommendation. You can test multiple recommendation types against each other by adding multiple criteria. 

This section contains the following information: 


* [ Industry Vertical](c_algorithms.md#section_936BCFCF234C49A2BEC1C38AAC2D71AF)

## Industry Vertical {#section_936BCFCF234C49A2BEC1C38AAC2D71AF}

You select an industry vertical based on the goals of your recommendations activity: 



<table id="table_B99C2269E3EA4D5AA710C03A6BBBB008">

## Recommendation Key {#section_885B3BB1B43048A88A8926F6B76FC482}

The recommendation key you select determines the criteria type. There are several criteria types, which are represented as criteria cards when you set up a [!DNL  Recommendations] activity.

## Criteria/Algorithms {#section_DC4E38A00B9744959F05F8E10A0087A1}

[!DNL  Target Recommendations] uses sophisticated algorithms to determine when a visitor's actions qualify for the criteria set in your activity. The recommendation key determines the recommendations logic options that are available.

You can also use additional known information about a visitor to enhance your recommendations. 

All one-day criteria run twice daily. All one-week and longer criteria run once daily. Site Affinity criteria run once daily. Backup criteria run twice daily. 

## Viewing Criteria Information {#section_7162DE58E4594FD688A4D7FDB829FD8B}

You can view criteria details on a pop-up card by hovering over a card and by clicking the Information icon (  ![](../assets/icon_information.png) ) on a criteria card without opening the criteria. 

![](../assets/criteria hover.png) 

Click the ** [!UICONTROL  Algorithm Info] ** tab to view general information about the selected criteria, including its Name, Descriptions, Industry Vertical, Page Type(s), Recommendation Key, Recommendation Logic, and Algorithm ID. 

![](../assets/criteria info.png) 

Click the ** [!UICONTROL  Algorithm Usage] ** tab to view a list of activities that reference the selected criteria. The card lists active and inactive activities. Click the Live Activities or Inactivities drop-down lists to view the entire list of activities that reference that criteria. You can click the activity link to open the activity for editing.

## Determining When Criteria Results are Ready to Display {#section_03F328C07F234692B6D996DF745584B3}

From the activity diagram, Criteria cards now indicate when results are ready to display. Knowing if results are ready to display helps you determine if your activity is ready to activate to push it live. Knowing if results are ready to display also helps you know if there are any issues with the criteria. 

The following illustration shows the activity diagram on a Recommendations activity's Overview page. You can also see the activity diagram with criteria status results from step 2 during the activity-creation workflow. 

![](../assets/criteria status.png) 

Status results include the following: Results Ready, Results Not Ready, and Feed Failure, as illustrated in the following diagram:
