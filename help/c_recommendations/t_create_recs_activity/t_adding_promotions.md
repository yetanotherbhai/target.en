# Adding Promotions


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Static and dynamic exclusion rules are powerful features that can help you with your marketing efforts. For detailed information, examples, and use-case scenarios, see[ Use Dynamic and Static Inclusion Rules](../../c_recommendations/t_create_recs_activity/c_use-dynamic-and-static-inclusion-rules.md#concept_4CB5C0FA705D4E449BD0B37B3D987F9F). 



When you create a [!DNL  Recommendations] activity, you have the option to include promoted items in your [!DNL  Recommendations] design. Promotions use available slots in a design and take precedence over criteria results and backup recommendations. For example, if your design has six slots and you use two of them for promotions, four slots are available for items recommended based on criteria. 

You can promote specific items, dynamically promote items, promote items based on attributes, or promote collections.
